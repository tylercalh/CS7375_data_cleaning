Scientific Name,Habitat Comments
Acris crepitans,"This species inhabits the edges of sunny marshes, marshy ponds, and small slow-moving streams in open country.  It may periodically range into adjacent nonwetland habitats in some regions.  Eggs and larvae develop in the shallow water of ponds, marshes, ditches, slow streams, springs, or rain pools. Hibernation sites are underground on land near water; may hibernate communally (e.g., McCallum and Trauth 2003)."
Acris gryllus,"Grassy margins of swamps, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, ditches, bogs, and nearby temporary pools, including such habitats in openly wooded areas that do not produce excessive shade. Eggs and larvae develop in shallow water."
Ambystoma bishopi,"The following information pertains to the <i>Ambystoma cingulatum</i>/<i>bishopi </i>complex as a whole. Post-larval individuals inhabit mesic longleaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i>)-wiregrass (<i>Aristida stricta</i>) flatwoods and savannas. The terrestrial habitat is best described as a topographically flat or slightly rolling wiregrass-dominated grassland having little to no midstory and an open overstory of widely scattered longleaf pine. Low-growing shrubs, such as saw palmetto (<i>Serenoa repens</i>), gallberry (<i>Ilex glabra</i>) and blueberries (<i>Vaccinium </i>spp.), co-exist with grasses and forbs in the ground cover. Ground cover plant diversity is usually very high. The underlying soil is typically poorly drained sand that becomes seasonally inundated.<br /><br />Slash pine flatwoods is often cited as the preferred terrestrial habitat of the flatwoods salamander (e.g., Conant and Collins 1991). This may be the result of an error made by Martof (1968) in which he referred to longleaf pine as slash pine (<i>Pinus elliottii</i>). In addition, slash pine now dominates or co-occurs with longleaf pine in many pine flatwoods communities as a result of fire suppression and preferential harvest of longleaf pine (Avers and Bracy 1975). Historically, however, fire-tolerant longleaf pine dominated the flatwoods, whereas slash pine was confined principally to wetlands (Harper 1914, Avers and Bracy 1975). Post-larval individuals are fossorial (live underground) and occupy burrows (Goin 1950, Neill 1951, Mount 1975, Ashton 1992). Presumably, they remain underground during the lightning-season (May through September). Adults are rarely encountered under cover objects at or near breeding sites (J. Palis, pers. obs.).<br /><br />Breeding occurs in acidic (pH 3.6-5.6 (Palis, unpubl. data)), tannin-stained ephemeral wetlands (swamps or graminoid-dominated depressions) that range in size from 0.02 to 9.5 ha, and are usually not more than 0.5 m deep (Palis, unpubl. data). The overstory is typically dominated by pond cypress (<i>Taxodium ascendens</i>), blackgum (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i> var. <i>biflora</i>) and slash pine, but can also include red maple (<i>Acer rubrum</i>), sweetgum (<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i>), sweetbay (<i>Magnolia virginiana</i>), and loblolly bay (<i>Gordonia lasianthus</i>). Canopy coverage ranges from near zero to almost 100% (Palis, unpubl. data). The midstory, which is often very dense, is most often composed of young of the aforementioned species, myrtle-leaved holly (<i>Ilex myrtifolia</i>), Chapman's St. John's-wort (<i>Hypericum chapmanii</i>), sandweed (<i>Hypericum fasciculatum</i>), titi (<i>Cyrilla racemiflora</i>), storax (<i>Styrax americana</i>), popash (<i>Fraxinus caroliniana</i>), sweet pepperbush (<i>Clethra alnifolia</i>), fetterbush (<i>Lyonia lucida</i>), vine-wicky (<i>Pieris phillyreifolia</i>), and bamboo-vine (<i>Smilax laurifolia</i>). Depending on closure of the canopy and midstory, the herbaceous groundcover of breeding sites can range from about 5% to nearly 100% (Palis, unpubl. data). The groundcover is dominated by graminaceous species, including beakrushes (<i>Rhynchospora </i>spp.), sedges (<i>Carex </i>spp.), panic grasses (<i>Panicum </i>spp.), bluestems (<i>Andropogon </i>spp.), jointtails (<i>Manisurus </i>spp.), three-awned grass (<i>Aristida affinis</i>), plumegrass (<i>Erianthus giganteus</i>), nutrush (<i>Sclera baldwinii</i>) and yellow-eyed grasses (<i>Xyris </i>spp.). The floor of breeding sites is riddled with the burrows of crayfish (genus <i>Procambarus</i>). Breeding sites are typically encircled by a wiregrass-dominated graminaceous ecotone. Breeding sites can include roadside ditches (Anderson and Williamson 1976; Palis, pers. obs.) and borrow pits (D. Stevenson, pers. comm.). Breeding sites often harbor fishes, the most typical species include pygmy sunfishes (<i>Elassoma </i>spp.), mosquitofish (<i>Gambusia holbrookii</i>), and banded sunfish (<i>Enneacanthus obesus</i>) (Palis, unpubl. data). Favorable breeding habitat lacks large predatory fishes.<br /><br />Before breeding sites fill with water, eggs are deposited singly or in small groups on the ground beneath leaf litter, under logs and <i>Sphagnum </i>mats, at the base of grasses, shrubs or trees, or at the entrance to crayfish burrows (Anderson and Williamson 1976). In wetlands that fill incrementally, eggs are deposited amid graminaceous vegetation at the edge (J. Palis, pers. obs.). Egg deposition in shallow water also has been reported (Ashton 1992). Larvae hide amid inundated graminaceous vegetation by day, but will enter the water column at night (J. Palis, pers. obs.)."

Ambystoma maculatum,"Spotted salamanders inhabit hardwood and mixed forests, in the vicinity of swamps and vernal pools. They are usually underground or under soil surface objects except during the breeding period. Logs, stumps, and mammal burrows provide important cover (Faccio 2003). In New York, distribution apparently is influenced by soil pH (Wyman 1988).<br><br>Eggs usually are attached to submerged stems or other objects in vernal pools and semipermanent or permanent ponds in or adjacent to forest. In many areas, the species breeds mainly in ponds inaccessible to predatory fishes; however on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States, spotted salamanders breed in sloughs or backwater lowland areas along streams that frequently contain or are easily colonized by predatory fishes that opportunistically feed on amphibian larvae (Semlitsch 1988). Eggs may be laid in ponds when they are ice-covered if salamanders already are present in the pond (States et al. 1988)."
Ambystoma opacum,"Marbled salamanders live in various wooded habitats, near swamps or vernal pools. They are more tolerant of dry habitats than are most salamanders and can be found on rocky bluffs and slopes and wooded sand dunes. Adults are entirely terrestrial and spend most of their time under surface objects or underground. Eggs are laid in forest depressions such as vernal pool basins and sometimes at the edges of permanent ponds, swamps, and slow-moving streams, in sites that lack standing water in late summer or early fall but are inundated by fall rains and generally hold standing water through winter and into at least early summer of the next year. Oviposition sites typically are in mineral soil beneath protective cover of leaf litter, logs, detritus, or rocks."
Ambystoma talpoideum,"Usually near breeding ponds--in pine flatwoods, floodplains, and bottomland hardwood forests. In South Carolina, avoided clearcuts and open fields, occurred in all types of forest (Semlitsch 1981). Terrestrial adults live in underground burrows; sometimes found under logs or other objects in damp places. Breeds in shallow ponds and flooded depressions that are free of fishes and that often have abundant emergent and/or submerged vegetation. Eggs are attached to stems or sticks or to the substrate. Reproductive success positively correlated with duration of standing water in breeding pond, but not with number of breeding females or number of eggs laid (Semlitsch 1987)."
Ambystoma tigrinum,"Tiger salamanders can be found in virtually any habitat, providing there is a terrestrial substrate suitable for burrowing and a body of water nearby suitable for breeding. Terrestrial adults usually are underground, in self-made burrows or in those made by rodents, shrews, or other animals. In New York, adults on land used wooded areas and avoided grassy areas (Madison and Farrand 1998). At high elevations in the Rocky Mountains, metamorphosed adults commonly occur in ponds throughout the summer. Breeding occurs in a wide range of environments, ranging from clear mountain ponds to temporary, manure-polluted pools in the lowlands, generally in sites where predatory fishes are absent. In the mountains of western Colorado, tiger salamanders are associated with ponds that have silty bottoms, low alkalinity, and no fishes (Geraghty and Willey 1992). In the southeastern U.S., this species breeds in open, grassy, usually temporary, ponds (Jensen et al. 2008). Eggs are attached to submerged objects or pond bottoms."
Amphiuma means,"Swamps, bayous, margins of muddy sloughs, cypress heads, drainage ditches, sluggish streams, wet meadows, muddy lakes; soft substrate for burrowing or thick aquatic vegetation important for shelter. Often uses crayfish burrows. May leave water, especially on rainy nights; sometimes found under objects at water's edge. Eggs have been found under objects in damp places near the water's edge and in chambers in sediments where the water has receded. Eggs appaear to be specialized for development in terrestrial nest chambers (Gunzburger 2003)."
Amphiuma pholeter,"Deep, organic, liquid muck in alluvial swamps of low-gradient 2nd or 3rd order streams, spring runs, and occasionally floodplain swampy terrace streams."
Anaxyrus americanus,"American toads live on land except during the brief breeding season. They live in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from forests to prairies, wherever there is sufficient moisture, food, and a suitable breeding site. They emerge from winter dormancy on land and migrate up to several hundred meters to breeding sites. Breeding occurs in shallows of slow- or nonflowing bodies of water, including both permanent and temporary pools, generally in sites with few if any fishes (e.g., Holomuzki 1995). In northern Minnesota, successful reproduction in acidic bog water either does not occur or is a rare event (Karns 1992)."
Anaxyrus fowleri,"Fowler's toads inhabit wooded areas, river valleys, and floodplains, including agricultural and residential areas, usually in areas with deep friable soils, up to at least several hundred meters from breeding sites. During cold weather or drought, they burrow underground or hide under rocks, plants, or other cover. Breeding sites include shallow water of marshes, rain pools, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, flooded areas, and other bodies of water lacking a strong current."
Anaxyrus quercicus,"Sandy pine flatwoods and oak scrub; open pine and pine-oak woods; pine or oak savannas with sandy soils; maritime forests. Occurs on some barrier islands in South Carolina. Seems to favor open-canopied pine flatwoods with grassy ground cover. When inactive, burrows underground or hides under surface objects. Eggs and larvae develop in rain pools, ditches, cypress and flatwoods ponds, and other flooded areas."
Anaxyrus terrestris,"Adaptable and ubiquitous. Occupies a wide variety of wooded and unwooded habitats, which usually have sandy soil. Burrows underground when inactive. Eggs and larvae develop in shallow water of permanent ponds, woodland pools, and flooded depressions."
Aneides aeneus,"Damp (but not wet) crevices in shaded rock outcrops and ledges. Also beneath loose bark and in cracks of standing or fallen trees (e.g., in cove hardwoods); sometimes in or under logs on ground (e.g., Wilson 2003). Sometimes reaches high population densities in logged areas where tree tops are left. Eggs are laid in rock crevices (e.g., Davis 2004), rotting stumps, or similar dark, damp places."
Cryptobranchus alleganiensis,"Rocky, clear creeks and rivers, usually where there are large shelter rocks. Usually avoids water warmer than 20∫ C. Males prepare nests and attend eggs beneath large flat rocks or submerged logs. The hellbender salamander, considered a ""habitat specialist,"" has adapted to fill a specific niche within a very specific environment, and is labeled as such ""because its success is dependent on a constancy of dissolved oxygen, temperature and flow found in swift water areas,"" which in turn limits it to a narrow spectrum of stream/river choices (Peterson et al. 1988). As a result of this specialization, hellbenders are generally found in areas with large, irregularly shaped, and intermittent rocks and swiftly moving water, while they tend to avoid wider, slow-moving waters with muddy banks and/or slab rock bottoms. This specialization likely contributed to the decline in their populations, as collectors could easily identify their specific habitats (Peterson et al. 1988)."
Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis,"Seepage salamanders inhabit moss, leaf litter, or surface debris on the floors of mixed hardwood forests near small creeks, springs, and seepage areas (Harrison 1967, Hining and Bruce 2005). They also occur in damp shaded ravines (Harrison 1967). Eggs are laid under moss or in small protected depressions (Harrison 1967)."
Desmognathus aeneus,"In or along swift, boulder-strewn mountain streams. Also near waterfalls and places where cold water drips or seeps. Refuges are in rock cevices or in burrows (Camp and Lee 1996). Usually under rocks in daytime. Sometimes basks in sun on wet rocks. Eggs are laid on undersides of rocks or on tree roots in streambed, apparently in headwater tributaries in North Carolina (Bruce 1985)."
Desmognathus amphileucus,"Within and adjacent to seepage streams within steep-sided ravines in slope forests; sometimes also in mucky floodplain and bottomland forests. Undisturbed, pristine ravines and seepage streams are ideal. Uses logs, rocks, leaf litter, and leaf packs for cover, also takes refuge in friable streambanks (Means and Karlin 1989). Eggs are attached in cluster to undersurface of twig or small log or rock, and are immersed in trickling water; larvae found in very shallow water trickling through decomposing litter on saturated sites adjacent to larger brooks, on sandy or organic substrates (Means and Karlin 1989)."
Desmognathus apalachicolae,"Mucky areas near springs, swamps, cypress heads, mud-bottomed streams, floodplain pools, and ravine streams where pockets of organic debris collect; usually in or near moving water. Environment usually acidic. Hides under leaves, logs, or debris or in burrows during day. Eggs are laid under or in logs or in depressions under moss or other cover near water."
Desmognathus aureatus,"Floodplains, sloughs, and mucky sites along upland streams. Usually near running or trickling water. Hides under leaves, rocks, or other objects in or near water, or in burrows. Eggs are laid near water under moss or rocks, in logs, and in stream-bank cavities. Larval stage usually aquatic."
Desmognathus auriculatus,Semiaquatic along small streams (Camp et al. 2002).
Desmognathus campi,"Rock-strewn woodland streams, seepages, and springs in north; floodplains, sloughs, and mucky sites along upland streams in south. Usually near running or trickling water. Hides under leaves, rocks, or other objects in or near water, or in burrows. Eggs are laid near water under moss or rocks, in logs, and in stream-bank cavities. Larval stage usually aquatic."
Desmognathus conanti,"Small to medium-sized, cool upland streams or spring runs. Hides under rocks in shallow water, most commonly in riffles. Intolerant of siltation. Attaches eggs to undersides of rocks or logs in main current of stream."
Desmognathus folkertsi,"Mountain streams, small rocky spring-fed brooks in hardwood- shaded ravines, seepeages, muddy section of streams. Hides under rocks or moss, and in burrows in mud banks. Sometimes perches on wet rocks. Eggs are laid on undersides of rocks or leaves in water or seepages; also under or in logs near water."
Desmognathus fuscus,"Habitat ranges from low gorges to the highest mountaintops in the Great Smoky Mountains (Petranka 1998). The species often is abundant on wet rock faces. At lower elevations and in winter, this salamander usually concentrates near seepage areas, springs, and small streams; it may range into adjacent wooded areas in wet weather. It is more terrestrial at higher elevations and is a characteristic inhabitant of the floor of spruce-fir forests. Individuals frequently climb plants on rainy nights (Petranka 1998). Adults and juveniles congregate in seepages and underground retreats in winter (Shealy 1975). Eggs are laid in wet rock crevices or under rocks, logs, or moss in seepage areas or near small streams, usually at or slightly above the water surface (Pope 1924, Martof and Rose 1963, Forester 1977, Bruce 1990, Petranka 1998)."
Desmognathus marmoratus,"Permanent wooded swamps (tupelo, cypress, birch, buttonbush, and vine tangles) bordering rivers and streams. May climb high into trees. Generally intolerant of impoundments that flood habitat. Males call from trees, shrubs, and vines that are in or next to water. Eggs and larvae develop in swamp pools."
Desmognathus monticola,"Cope's gray treefrogs inhabit wooded areas and woodland edges (including woodlots in prairies), usually within a few hundred meters of the aquatic habitats in whch they breed. Often they occur in recently disturbed areas with abundant shrubs, herbaceous growth, and vines. Activity is arboreal and terrestrial. In Tennessee, frogs associated with knothole cavities in trees in fall were not there after mid-November (Ritke and Babb 1991). When inactive, frogs may hide in tree holes, under bark, under leaves, or under tree roots.<br><br>Breeding sites include temporary or permanent waters of flooded ditches, puddles, river sloughs, creeks, and small ponds, where there are woody branches or extensive herbaceous growth along the edges. Males call from the water surface or from vegetation or ground near water. Individuals generally breed in the same site in successive years (Ritke et al. 1991)."
Desmognathus ocoee,"Green treefrogs inhabit swamps, marshes, and areas adjacent to ponds, lakes, and slow streams, particularly where aquatic habitats include abundant floating and emergent vegetation. Little is known about the habits of green treefrogs outside the breeding season; they may overwinter in upland situations near wetlands. Eggs and larvae develop in shallow, still, permanent or long-lasting temporary water. Males call while perched on plants next to water or while sitting on floating plants."
Desmognathus perlapsus,"Pine woods treefrogs inhabit longleaf pine-wiregrass flatwoods and savannas and longleaf pine-turkey oak sandhills, usually near bogs or ponds. Occasionally they occur in hardwood forests and swamps. Activity is mostly arboreal, with perch sites ranging from low shrubs to high tree tops. frogs may hide under or in rotting logs, stumps, or snags during dry or cold weather. Eggs and larvae develop in flooded ditches and transient pools and ponds, occasionally in cypress swamps."
Desmognathus valtos,"Sandy areas in pine savannas and in low wet woods and swamps (e.g., willow oak-blackgum, cypress swamps). When inactive during cold or dry season, burrows under tree roots, vegetation, or in soil; otherwise mostly arboreal and thus dependent on trees near water. Eggs and larvae develop in shallow water of ponds, swamps, and bayheads; in Virginia, breeding sites were temporary ponds dominated by graminoids, beneath open canopies (Mitchell 1991). Reproduction is more successful in semi-permanent ponds due to the absence of predatory fishes. In some areas, deep ponds, such as Carolina Bays and barrow pits, are preferred breeding sites."
Dryophytes avivoca,"Open woods, cities, and towns; thick low vegetation near water; wherever there is adequate moisture, hiding places, nearby standing water, and insect food. When inactive, hides under loose bark, palm leaves, in tree holes, in gardens, and in other protected sites. Nonbreeding ""rain call"" given by males from trees and bushes when rainfall is impending. Eggs and larvae develop in flooded roadside ditches, flatwoods ponds, swamps, and small, semipermanent stock-watering ponds. Males call from debris and twigs above water, on ground near water, or hidden in grass clumps adjacent to permanent or temporary rain pools of moderate depth (Schwartz and Henderson 1991)."
Dryophytes chrysoscelis,"Gray treefrogs inhabit various kinds of wooded and forested habitats and may occur on the ground or more often in shrubs or trees. Inactive individuals may be in tree holes, under bark, in rotten logs, under leaves, and under tree roots.Breeding sites include shallow woodland ponds and marshes, puddles, ponds in forest clearings, swamps, bogs, and many other kinds of permanent or temporary, natural or human-created waters lacking a significant current. In northern Minnesota, successful reproduction in acidic bog water either does not occur or is a rare event (Karns 1992). In central Ontario, embryos and larvae exhibited high degree of acid tolerance (J. Herpetol. 26:1-6). The presence of snails (which may harbor trematodes that infect frogs) may influence choice of oviposition site by <i>H. versicolor </i>(Kiesecker and Skelly 2000)."
Dryophytes cinereus,"Terrestrial; areas with shelter and moisture--broadleaf forest, gardens, greenhouses and well-watered nurseries, lawns, dumps, gopher tortoise burrows, small stream valleys, hardwood hammocks with damp leaf litter, beach COCOS trash. Under debris or in similar damp site when inactive. May perch on low grass, occasionally in bromeliads above ground (Grand Cayman) (Schwartz and Henderson 1991). Males call from on or near ground, often on leaves or debris (Schwartz and Henderson 1991). <br><br>Terrestrial breeder; no aquatic larval stage. Eggs laid among vegetation or debris (Conant 1975, Behler and King 1979); under rocks, vegetal debris, in rooted plank in woodpile in cutover scrub, in fallen bromeliad (Schwartz and Henderson 1991)."
Dryophytes femoralis,Springs and streams in wooded areas; generally under rocks or logs or among aquatic vegetation in pools or riffles; eggs are laid probably on the undersides of rocks or logs in flowing water (Kozak and Lannoo 2005).
Dryophytes gratiosus,"Rocky brooks, springs, seepages, river swamps (e.g., tupelo-cypress), forested floodplains with stagnant pools; may disperse into wooded terrestrial habitats in wet warm weather. Adults hide under objects in or near flowing water. Often found crossing roads in rainy weather during breeding season. Eggs are laid on/under submerged rocks, logs, or aquatic plants, usually in flowing water, locally in ponds."
Dryophytes squirellus,"Forested floodplains, ditches, damp streamsides, seepage springs. May disperse into wooded terrestrial habitats in wet weather. Hides in rock crevices, crayfish burrows, and under rocks, logs, and other debris. Eggs are laid in underground crevices associated with springs, temporary pools, and slow-moving streams; under rocks in streams; in bogs; or in woodland ponds."
Dryophytes versicolor,"Bay swamps, the periphery and upper end of beaver ponds, isolated wetlands, and lazy first-order streams and seepage ravines provide habitat for this species. Sphagnum moss (<i>Sphagnum </i>spp.) is commonly extensive in appropriate habitat and provides ideal shelter and moisture for the salamanders. Larvae are presumed to occur in flowing water within and near adult habitats."
Eleutherodactylus planirostris,"Streamsides, spring runs, cave mouths, abandoned mines; also ponds in northern New Jersey (Conant and Collins 1991). May disperse into wooded terrestrial habitats in wet weather. Hides in rock crevices and under rocks, logs, and other debris. Eggs are laid in underground crevices associated with springs, temporary pools, and streams; under rocks in streams; in woodland ponds; or are attached to objects in or above water in caves."
Eurycea aquatica,"Caves (usually limestone); also rocky streams and springs, and wooded areas and fields, usually near caves or limestone outcrops. Hides under objects during day in noncave areas, except in wet weather when it may be in the open. Eggs are laid in cave streams or pools, springs, or in rocky streams outside of caves. Larvae remain in cave pools until winter or early spring when pools begin to overflow; larvae washed into larger streams, remain there until metamorphosis"
Eurycea cirrigera,"Low swampy areas, margins of pine savanna ponds, bottomland forests. Hides under logs or other debris during day. In Alabama, peaks in terrestrial activity coincided with late fall-early winter rains (Trauth 1983). Lays eggs in seepage areas or near the edge of shallow ponds on undersides of logs or leaves, under or on sphagnum or pine needles, or on rootlets beneath logs."
Eurycea guttolineata,"<span><span>The species inhabits subterranean waters of caves formed in limestone, including in caves used by bats. It is most easily seen resting on bottom sediments in small pools, but extent of use of less accessible waters in the aquifer is unknown. Specimens have also been pumped from deep groundwater wells.</span></span>"
Eurycea hillisi,"Rocky brooks, springs, seepages; may disperse into terrestrial habitats in wet warm weather. Adults hide under objects in or near water. Eggs are laid in water on underside of rock, log, etc."
Eurycea longicauda,"Eastern narrow-mouthed toads occur a wide variety of habitats, usually in areas with sandy or loamy soils. On land, they range up to several hundred meters from water. They burrow underground or hide beneath objects in daytime and when conditions are cold or dry. Breeding sites include lakes, ponds, sloughs, flooded roadside ditches, swamps, stream margins, rain puddles, etc., in both temporary and permanent waters. Males call from sheltered locations, often from beneath objects at the water's edge or partially buried in grass."
Eurycea lucifuga,"Occurs in streams in caves that contain amphipods and other aquatic organisms that can serve as food; individuals may be found in rimstone pools, stream runs and pools, and pools isolated by receding waters; water tends to be clear and free of sediment; substrates include rock, gravel, sand, and mud (Godwin 1995). Sinkholes are an important habitat component, allowing for detritus inflow (Caldwell and Copeland 1992). Occasionally occurs in epigean environments; probably these individuals have been washed out of caves (Bury et al. 1980)."
Eurycea quadridigitata,"Small, clear upland streams; clear springs; caves; shaded seepages; occasionally in swamps and lake margins. Sometimes also in forested wet areas away from streams, especially during rainy periods. Often under rocks, logs, leaves, or moss in or near water. Eggs usually are attached to undersides of rocks in running water. <br><br>Adams and Beachy (2001) documented morphological variation among populations in the southern Appalachian Mountains and found patterns ""consistent with the hypothesis that large rivers restrict sizable gene flow."""
Eurycea wallacei,"Adults live under objects or among mosses in swamps, boggy streams, and wet, wooded or open areas near ponds or quiet, mossy or grassy/sedgy pools (the larval habitat). Sphagnum moss is commonly abundant in suitable habitat. <br><br>Eggs are laid in moss or other protected sites immediately above or next to a pool, into which the larvae drop or wriggle after hatching."
Eurycea wilderae,"Primary habitat is native xeric upland habitats, particularly longleaf pine-turkey oak sandhill associations; also xeric to mesic longleaf pine flatwoods, sand pine scrub, xeric oak hammocks, and ruderal successional stages of these habitats; generally occurs only where there are gopher tortoises, but rare or absent at most tortoise colonies; absent from most coastal islands and dunes (Godley 1992). Burrows of gopher tortoise or rodents are used for shelter (Gentry and Smith 1968, Lee 1968, Franz 1986); hides also under logs, under or in stumps, and in sewers (Wright and Wright 1949).<br /><br />Breeding occurs in ephemeral to semi-permanent graminoid-dominated wetlands that lack large predatory fishes (Bailey 1991; Moler and Franz 1987; Palis, unpubl. data). Gopher frogs have also been observed breeding in ditches and borrow pits (Means 1986), and have been heard calling from a recently re-filled, normally permanent wetland following an extreme drought (Franz 1991). The reproductive habitat is best described as a circular or near- circular depression marsh, ranging from 0.02 ha to 33.3 ha (Palis and Jensen 1995, Enge et al. 2014). Dominant emergent graminaceous vegetation typically includes maidencane (<i>Panicum hemitomon</i>), panic grasses (<i>Panicum </i>spp.), bluestem (<i>Andropogon </i>sp.), yellow-eyed grasses (<i>Xyris </i>spp.), pipewort (<i>Eriocaulon compressum</i>), beakrushes (<i>Rhynchospora </i>spp.), and spikerushes (<i>Eleocharis </i>spp.). Most breeding sites have a small component of woody vegetation such as St. John's-wort (<i>Hypericum fasciculatum</i>), myrtle-leaved holly (<i>Ilex myrtifolia</i>), and slash pine that is typically restricted to the edge. Gopher frogs occasionally breed in pond-cypress (<i>Taxodium ascendens</i>)- dominated depressions (Godley 1992, Palis pers. obs.).<br /><br />Egg masses are laid within an average of 4.5 cm (range 0-20 cm) of the surface, in water 33-78 cm (mean 59 cm) deep, typically attached to vertical stems of graminaceous emergent vegetation (Palis, unpubl. data), as well as to semi-woody weedy vegetation or small (&lt;8 mm) woody stems (e.g., branches of St John's-wort or myrtle-leaved holly). Egg masses may also be deposited on the bottom in shallow water (Bailey, pers. comm.).<br /><br />Habitat suitability models indicated that number of wetlands, well-drained soil, compatible land cover, and frequent fires were the most important predictors of habitat for the species (Crawford et al. 2020)."
Gastrophryne carolinensis,"American bullfrogs inhabit ponds, swamps, lakes, reservoirs, marshes, brackish ponds (e.g., Hawaii), stream margins, and irrigation ditches, especially sites with abundant floating, emergent, or submerged vegetation. They may disperse from water in wet weather and sometimes are found in temporary waters hundreds of meters from permanent water. Bullfrogs sometimes make seasonal migrations to and from ephemeral bodies of water, or between adjacent permanent aquatic habitats. Individuals often remain in one pond or in a cluster of adjacent ponds throughout a season but may move up to a mile or more from one year to the next. Breeding sites are primarily permanent slow- or nonflowing bodies of water."
Gyrinophilus palleucus,"Green frogs inhabit virtually any body of permanent or semipermanent water, as well as vernal pools, and juveniles regularly use nearby small temporary pools and puddles. Individuals may disperse from water in wet weather, especially at night. In winter, they shelter under objects on land, underground, or in water. Many overwinter in flowing water of small streams. Wintering sites may be in breeding areas or commonly several hundred meters away. Breeding sites are in shallow, slow- or nonflowing water."
Gyrinophilus palleucus palleucus,"Permanent lakes, ponds, swamps, marshes, and streams; especially those with abundant emergent or floating herbaceous vegetation; old rice fields and rice field reservoirs. Occurs in mangroves in the Bahamas (Schwartz and Henderson 1991). Eggs and larvae develop in permanent bodies of water. In South Carolina, males moved from cypress-hardwood zone to grass-herb zone 40-50 m from shore during breeding period; females in grass-herb zone were ready to ovulate (Lamb 1984). When calling, males float in water."
Gyrinophilus porphyriticus,Swamps along streams and edges of shallow ponds and impoundments (including beaver ponds). Eggs and larvae develop in permanent swamp waters.
Hemidactylium scutatum,"Pickerel frogs occur in various freshwater aquatic and wetland habitats in wooded regions, ranging from the vicinity of cool clear streams and ponds in the north to warm, turbid swamps in parts of the south. In summer, they commonly range into fields and woods away from ponds or streams. In winter, they may be hidden at the bottom of a water body or secluded in wet caves.Breeding sites include standing water of woodland ponds, bog ponds, impoundments, stream pools, sloughs, and flooded ditches, often but not always in sites with few or no fishes (e.g., Holomuzki 1995). Males call while floating or submerged. Females attach egg masses to submerged vegetation."
Lithobates capito,"Southern leopard frogs occur in the vicinity of virtually any freshwater habitat and in some locations inhabit slightly brackish marshes. In summer they may disperse from water into moist upland vegetation. Breeding occurs in still, shallow, permanent or temporary waters of many kinds. Males call usually from shallow or deep water while floating or submerged, sometimes while hidden in crayfish burrows. Egg masses may be attached to vegetation or float free in shallow water. "
Lithobates catesbeianus,"Wood frogs inhabit various kinds of wooded habitats, including the edges of ponds and streams and willow thickets and grass/willow/aspen associations. In winter or when otherwise inactive, they hide in logs, humus, leaf litter, or under logs and rocks. In winter upland habitat in eastern Massachusetts, adult males greatly outnumbered adult females in areas close to (within 65 meters of) breeding pools; two wintering areas were not used during the summer active period (Regosin et al. 2003).<br><br>Eggs are laid and larvae develop usually in vernal pools and other small fish-free ponds, temporary or permanent, in wooded (usually) or open areas. In the Shenandoah Mountains, breeding adults were 100% faithful to the ponds in which they first bred; approximately 18% of the juveniles dispersed to breed in ponds other than the one of origin (Berven and Grudzien 1991). Experiments and field observations by Hopey and Petranka (1994) indicate that adults are able to assess the presence of fishes in ponds and may change breeding sites accordingly to avoid those with predatory fishes. In northern Minnesota, successful reproduction in acidic bog water either does not occur or is a rare event (Karns 1992)."
Lithobates clamitans,"Sphagnum bogs and swamps and sphagnum borders of lakes and ponds; tea-colored, slow-moving water with abundant emergent or floating vegetation. Active adults occur at the water's edge or on partly submerged logs or among vegetation. Often in same habitats as HYLA ANDERSONII. Eggs are laid and larvae develop in pools in adult year-around habitat (see HABCOMM); globular egg masses are attached to underwater vegetation. In southern New Jersey, calling sites had more submerged shrubs than did control sites (Given 1988)."
Lithobates grylio,N/A
Lithobates heckscheri,N/A
Lithobates palustris,"Bottoms of slow, sand- or mud-bottomed streams and connected ditches, cypress swamps; also stream-fed rice fields and mill ponds. Favors bottoms with leaf litter and detritus. Juveniles burrow into bottom. Adults congregate in leaf beds in winter. Eggs probably are attached to undersides of objects in water."
Lithobates sphenocephalus,"Terrestrial adults and efts utilize mostly xeric upland habitats, particularly sandhill, scrub, scrubby flatwoods, and sometimes mesic flatwoods. Within these habitats, isolated and usually ephemeral (though sometimes permanent) wetlands are used for breeding; these may include sinkhole ponds, depression ponds and marshes, cypress domes, and even borrow pits and ditches. A key feature of breeding ponds is the absence of large predatory fishes. Eggs probably are attached to submerged vegetation, and larvae are aquatic; they typically leave wetlands as efts, which mature to adulthood in upland wooded areas within a few hundred meters of breeding ponds. At some sites with longer hydroperiods, larvae may remain in ponds and mature as aquatic adults (paedomorphs), which may emigrate to surrounding terrestrial habitats if ponds dry."
Lithobates sylvaticus,"Adults and larvae inhabit lakes, ponds, swamps, and quiet stream pools, especially those lacking predaceous fishes. Efts and sometimes adults (for example, overwintering ones) inhabit wooded areas (terrestrial eft stage lasts 2-7 years). In some areas, such as the northeastern United States, adults may be permanently aquatic, but in other areas they may leave the water in summer or fall."

Plethodon petraeus,"Vicinity of moist rocky crevices in ravines, canyons, rubble, seepages, caves, and wooded slopes. Under rocks, logs, or leaves during day."
Plethodon savannah,"This salamander inhabits mesophytic forest, often mixed pine/hardwood, sometimes relatively early successional forest (maple, hickory, oak, poplar, and elm) bordering rocky feeder streams; usually found under logs, bark, and leaf litter on the forest floor and along rocky stream beds (unless inundated). For their oversummering subterranean, oviposition refugia, they prefer accessible, fissured, shallowly buried rock. Terrestrial breeder."
Plethodon serratus,"Low areas in hardwood forests, swamps near rivers and streams, marshes, and wet open woods. Eggs and larvae develop in flooded ditches and shallow ponds. Adults and juveniles have been found well away from water in mixed pine and hardwood forests, pine forests, secondary dune scrub forest, forested wetlands dominated by red maple, loblolly pine (<i>Pinus taeda</i>), and sweetgum (<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i>), and cultivated fields. Reproduction is aquatic."
Plethodon shermani,"Southern Piedmont dry pine forest, East Gulf dry upland hardwood forest, and southern Ridge and Valley/Cumberland dry calcareous forest (Ospina et al. 2020). These habitats contain dry to dry-mesic forests primarily dominated by pine and oak species. This species is associated with areas where precipitation during the driest season is relatively high (~260ñ500 mm), which probably allows for their survival in predominantly drier habitats (Ospina et al. 2020). It has also been observed breeding in regularly mowed orchard environments where breeding ponds are available and forest habitat is nearby (McCoy et al. 2021)."
Plethodon teyahalee,"Spring peepers inhabit moist wooded areas near breeding pools. They are mostly ground dwelling, and they hide under logs, rocks, or other objects when not active on the surface, such as during the cold winter months in the north. Eggs are laid and larvae develop in small temporary or permanent waters of ponds (including those in fields with nearby forest), marshes, ditches, and swamps, especially those with standing plants, sticks, or other debris. In northern Minnesota, successful reproduction in acidic bog water either does not occur or is a rare event (Karns 1992). Males call from among vegetation adjacent to or standing in water, or while perched low in woody vegetation away from water.<br><br>"
Plethodon variolatus,"Habitat includes open and wooded areas such as meadows, moist forests, bottomland swamps, and the vicinity of ponds, bogs, and marshes; this is mainly an upland frog in the north, but it also inhabits lowlands in the south (Conant and Collins 1991). Breeding sites include shallow ponds, flooded woodlands and pastures, and rainwater pools in ditches, fields, and open woods; eggs adhere to sticks and grass (Mount 1975, Redmond and Scott 1996)."
Plethodon ventralis,"Southern chorus frogs inhabit pine flatwoods, pine-oak forests, sandhills, and cleared and otherwise disturbed habitats. Most of the year these frogs are primarily terrestrial, and they may burrow among plant material or into the ground when conditions are unsuitable for surface activity. Breeding sites include flooded grassy depressions, roadside ditches, margins of shallow ponds, sinkhole ponds, and other temporary pools, often including those in distrubed areas. Females attach eggs to submerged vegetation."
Plethodon websteri,"Grassy/sedgy areas near bogs or ponds in pine flatwoods or along pools and streams in hardwood forests and cypress swamps. Usually perched in grasses, sedges, or low shrubs. Eggs are laid and larvae develop in grassy, rain-filled depressions and semi-permanent ponds."
Pseudacris brimleyi,"Ornate chorus frogs inhabit sandhills, pine flatwoods, upland pine forests, and other habitats up to at least several hundred meters from breeding pools. They burrow into the ground (often among herbaceous plant roots) when not active on the surface. Adults are seldom observed except when breeding. Eggs are attached to plant stems in flooded fields, sinkhole ponds, pine barren ponds, Carolina bays, and cypress ponds."
Pseudacris collinsorum,"Generally this species inhabits cypress and gum swamps (Liu et al. (2004). In the area of sympatry with <i>P. axanthus</i>, <i>P. striatus</i> occurs in cypress ponds in areas of acid pine flatwoods (Moler and Kezer 1993). Usually found in thick vegetation (e.g., floating mats of frog's bit, LIMNOBIUM SPONGIA) or in bottom mud and debris. Burrows into and estivates in mud bottom when ponds dry up. <br><br>Subspecies <i>lustricolus</i>: may be essentially restricted to wetlands within the narrow strip of hydric hardwood hammock along the Gulf Coast (Moler 1992); stagnant ponds associated with cypress and flatwood ponds, drainage ditches, and smaller floodplain lakes (Neill 1951). Eggs are attached to or scattered among submerged vegetation."
Pseudacris crucifer,"Muddy springs, slow floodplain streams, and swamps along slow streams; backwater ponds and marshes created by beaver activity. Nonlarval forms usually occur beneath logs and rocks, in decaying vegetation, and in muddy stream-bank burrows. Occasionally disperses from wet muddy areas. Secretive, sometimes difficult to detect. <br><br>Eggs are attached separately to objects in water (e.g., undersides of leaves in quiet pool, Green and Pauley 1987)."
Pseudacris feriarum,"Cold, clear, rocky streams and springs in wooded or open areas. Adults occur in or near water in leaf litter and under rocks, and in crevices and burrows near water. Adults sometimes disperse into woods. Eggs are attached to underside of rocks in water. Larvae occur in still pools."
Pseudacris nigrita,"Eastern spadefoots occur in areas of sandy, gravelly, or soft, light soils in wooded or unwooded terrain. On land, they range up to at least several hundred meters from breeding sites. When inactive, they remain burrowed in the ground. Eggs and larvae develop in temporary pools formed by heavy rains. Breeding sites include temporary pools and areas flooded by heavy rains."
Pseudacris ocularis,"It inhabits shallow, warm, quiet, sometimes turbid waters with abundant vegetation: swamps, sloughs, ponds, lakes, ditches, and to a lesser degree rivers and streams.

Pseudacris ornata,"It lives in shallow, muddy, weed-choked water: swamps, ponds, lakes, streams, ditches. It is found among thick vegetation, under rocks and logs, or burrowed in bottom mud by day. It burrows into bottom and estivates if water recedes or dries up during drought. The eggs are laid in water in small clusters on bottom."
Pseudobranchus striatus,"Cypress and gum swamps, small ponds in pine forests, large drainage ditches, sluggish streams. Adults occur in moss or under leaf debris in water, or under objects at water's edge. Primarily aquatic. Eggs are laid in or under logs or attached to plants in or near water."
Pseudobranchus striatus spheniscus,"Strictly found in the headwaters of streams within steep-walled ravines in mature, closed-canopy deciduous mesic slope forest. Streams are first- or second-order streams typically less than 3 m wide, with water typically less than 10 cm deep, and flow rates less than 1 m/sec (Camp et al. 2018). These streams are often lined with <i>Rhododendron maximum</i> or <i>R. minus</i> (Camp et al. 2018). Adults can be found under rocks or in leaf litter along the stream banks."
Pseudobranchus striatus striatus,"BREEDING: Primarily mature forest, either broadleaf or coniferous, mostly the former; also open woodland and forest edge (AOU 1983, Rosenfield and Bielefeldt 1993). Nests in both pine and hardwood groves, and riparian cottonwoods and sycamores in the West; Douglas-fir in northeastern Oregon. Usually builds new nest on horizontal limb near trunk or in crotch, 6-18 meters above ground; may modify old one or squirrel or crow nest. Campbell et al. (1990) reported one instance of a nest being reused for six consecutive years in British Columbia. Rosenfield and Bielefeldt (1992) found that nesting areas were irregularly reused by the same or different adults in subsequent years.<br /><br />In Nevada, Cooper's Hawks were frequently sighted in montane forests and pinyon-juniper woodlands, but riparian habitat was recorded as well (Floyd et al. 2007). In California, this species is seldom found in areas without dense tree stands, or patchy woodland habitat. It nests in deciduous trees in crotches 3-23 m (10-80 ft), but usually 6-15 m (20-50 ft), above the ground. It also nests in conifers on horizontal branches, in the main crotch, often just below the lowest live limbs. They usually nest in second-growth conifer stands, or in deciduous riparian areas, usually near streams. They frequent landscapes where wooded areas occur in patches and groves (Beebe 1974) and often use patchy woodlands and edges with snags for perching (CDFG 2011). Cooper's Hawks tend to use older, taller, and less dense woodlots than Sharp-shinned Hawks in California (Rosenfield and Bielefeldt 1993). In southern California, Cooper's Hawk generally favors extensive riparian bottomlands (Garrett and Dunn 1981). In Oregon, nests were in stands of conifers that included older and taller trees, a deeper crown, and a more open understory than a typical single-story Sharp-shinned Hawk nest stand (Reynolds et al. 1982). See also Grindrod and Walton Cooper's Hawk account at http://www.blm.gov/ca/pdfs/cdd_pdfs/coha.pdf.<br /><br />Generally is an inhabitant of deep woods, utilizing thick cover both for nesting and hunting. Openings, especially where hedgerows or windbreaks offer shelter for prey species, may also be used when foraging. Johnsgard (1990) states that Cooper's are less fussy about the forest type than sharp-shins, and are more often ""associated with deciduous and mixed forests and open woodland habitats such as woodlots, riparian woodlands, semiarid woodlands of the southwest, and other areas where the woodlands tend to occur in patches and groves or as spaced trees."" <br /><br />In the Northwest and Northeast, conifers are used for nesting (Bent 1937, Reynolds et al. 1982), but elsewhere the preference is for hardwoods (Brown and Amadon 1968). In the Northwest a preference may exist also for the cooler microclimates offered by north and east facing slopes (Reynolds et al. 1982). In that area, the Cooper's hawk is typically found in middle-aged stands, 50 - 60 years in age, whereas the sharp-shin prefers younger stands and the goshawk older ones (Reynolds et al. 1982). That difference might express competitive displacement, because in the East, where the goshawk rarely nests, the Cooper's hawk prefers mature stands (Brown and Amadon 1968). <br /><br />In some areas the species seems to require large tracts of forests and to avoid human contact, in others they may use small forest tracts, (e.g., British Columbia and Nevada), woodlots (e.g., Ohio) or urban/suburban areas where they seem tolerant of human activities (e.g., British Columbia, Utah, Wisconsin, Indiana) (Hennessy 1978, Herron et al. 1985, Campbell et al 1990, Peterjohn and Rice 1991, Rosenfield et al. 1991). <br /><br />In New Jersey-New York, nested mostly in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest with eastern hemlock the dominant coniferous species at many sites. Tended to nest in areas with relatively large basal area and more canopy cover. Nests located in live overstory trees (43% conifers), typically within the canopy, and always in dense forest but commonly near wetland openings or source of water, on level ground or lower slopes, typically several hundred meters from paved roads (but sometimes within 100 meters or less). Avoided southern exposures (Reynolds et al. 1982, Bosakowski et al. 1992). <br /><br />A recent study in Missouri documented numerous Cooper's Hawks nesting in young pine plantations in essentially the same habitat as sharp-shins. Also found that trees with deformed crowns were preferred (Wiggers and Kritz 1991). Rosenfield et al. (1991) report that pine plantations are important habitat for breeding Cooper's hawks throughout the Midwest, and particularly in Wisconsin. See Kennedy (1988) for details on nesting habitat in New Mexico. <br /><br />NON-BREEDING: Migrates mostly along ridges and coastlines (NGS 1983). Winter habitat is much the same as in the nesting season, although open woodlands and fields may be utilized to a greater extent."
Pseudotriton montanus,"Forest and open woodland, coniferous, mixed, or deciduous, primarily in coniferous in more northern and mountainous portion of range (AOU 1983). Primary habitat is boreal forest, with the greatest nesting densities occurring in eastern Canada. Young, dense, mixed or coniferous woodlands are preferred for nesting (Platt 1976, Reynolds et al. 1982, Meyer 1987). Where conifers are scarce, as in the prairie regions, cottonwoods, poplars, and other members of the Betulaceae may be used (Bent 1937). Migrates through various habitats, mainly along ridges, lakeshores, and coastlines (NGS 1983). Nests usually in tree crotch or on branch next to trunk, most often 3-18 m up, hidden by thick foliage, usually in conifer in north. May build new nest, reuse old one, or modify old bird or squirrel nest. Nests generally seem to be in a stand of dense conifers near a forest opening, though this may reflect observer bias (Meyer 1987). Pairs apparently remain faithful to nesting areas for several years, although a new nest is usually constructed each season. However, this may not be universally true (Herron et al., 1985, stated that pairs are not faithful to a nest site). <br><br>In Nevada, nesting occurs at elevations of 6500-9000 feet, intermediate between Cooper's below, and goshawks above (Herron et al. 1985). <br><br>One study quantified habitat parameters for nest sites in pine plantations in Missouri (Wiggers and Kritz 1991). The nest sites were characterized as medium age (25-49 yr), with high tree density (1370 trees/ha), basal area (37 sq m per ha), and percentage canopy coverage (82%). Nest trees were usually of normal growth form and nests were in the canopy. In this study, Cooper's hawks also nested in the same type of habitat, with essentially the same characteristics, but chose deformed nest trees most often and placed nests below canopy. Sharp-shin nesting sites were in stands averaging 11.8 ha compared to an average of 4.1 ha for Cooper's hawks in pine stands or 53 ha for Cooper's in hardwood habitat (Wiggers and Kritz 1991). <br><br>The foraging habitat during the breeding season is essentially the same as that chosen for nesting, and the birds appear to avoid open, deciduous forests, at least in Canada (Meyer 1987). During the winter, however, the males tend to hunt most frequently along hedgerows, field edges and other ecotonal habitats, while females usually stick to extensive stands of forest or riparian areas (Meyer 1987)."
Pseudotriton ruber,"Seacoasts and shores of lakes, ponds, and streams, sometimes in marshes; prefers shores with rocks, wood, or debris; also mangrove edges in Caribbean. Nests near freshwater in both open and wooded areas, less frequently in open grassy areas away from water; on ground in growing herbage or low shrubby growth, or against log or plant tuft (Harrison 1978). In Minnesota, successful breeders usually returned to same area to breed the next year (Reed and Oring 1993)."
Scaphiopus holbrookii,"Dense coniferous or mixed forest, cedar groves, alder thickets, swamps, and tamarack bogs; also, when not breeding, in dense second growth, brushy areas, arid scrub, and open buildings. Often roosts in dense evergreens in winter, at various heights and usually close to the trunk (Swengel and Swengel 1992a). Nests usually in old woodpecker hole, also in other tree cavity, or in nest box. Roosts during daylight in or near nest hole during breeding season (NGS 1983). Suitable holes have diameter of 7 cm or more."
Siren intermedia,"Habitat includes freshwater and brackish marshes, bushes and small trees along watercourses, and upland cultivated fields. In migration and winter, this blackbird also occurs in open cultivated lands, plowed fields, pastures, and prairies (AOU 1998). Nests usually are near water, in cattails, rushes, or sedges, occasionally in shrubs or trees."
Siren lacertina,"Quiet inland waters near woodland, such as wooded swamps, flooded forest, greentree reservoirs, ponds, marshes, and along streams. Winters on both freshwater and brackish marshes, ponds, streams, and estuaries (AOU 1983, Dugger and Fredrickson 1992). <br><br>Nests in holes in large trees in forested wetlands, and in bird boxes, usually within 0.5 km of water and near forest canopy openings, sometimes 1 km or more from water. Prefers cavities with an entrance size of at least 9 cm, an interior basal area of at least 258 sq cm, and a height of 2 m or more above ground (Dugger and Fredrickson 1992). Elms and maples are important habitat components in most areas because they provide protein-rich samaras in spring and suitable nest cavities. Often returns to same nesting area, sometimes same nest box, in successive years. If nest destroyed, moves to new site to renest. After young leave nest, female may led them up to several km to suitable habitat (food and cover). Shallowly flooded habitat with good understory cover is important cover for broods. Commonly lays eggs in nests of conspecifics."
Stereochilus marginatus,"BREEDING: Prefer grasslands of intermediate height and are often associated with clumped vegetation interspersed with patches of bare ground (Bent 1968, Blankespoor 1980, Vickery 1996). Other habitat requirements include moderately deep litter and sparse coverage of woody vegetation (Smith 1963, Bent 1968, Wiens 1969, Kahl et al. 1985, Arnold and Higgins 1986). Breed in both native and tame grassland vegetation (Kendeigh 1941, Birkenholz 1973, Whitmore 1979, Sample 1989, Wilson and Belcher 1989, Madden 1996), including native prairie, Conservation Reserve Program fields, pasture, hayland, airports, and reclaimed surface mines (Wiens 1973, Ducey and Miller 1980, Whitmore 1980, Kantrud 1981, Renken 1983, Renken and Dinsmore 1987, Bollinger 1988, Frawley and Best 1991, Johnson and Schwartz 1993, Berthelsen and Smith 1995, Hull et al. 1996, Patterson and Best 1996, Delisle and Savidge 1997, Prescott 1997). Occasionally inhabit cropland, such as corn and oats, but at a fraction of the densities found in grassland habitats (Smith 1963, Smith 1968, Ducey and Miller 1980, Basore et al. 1986, Faanes and Lingle 1995, Best et al. 1997). <br><br>In South Dakota, preferred large patches of appropriate grassland habitat; in landscapes not dominated by grassland, occupancy rate of patches greater than 50 hectares was 67%, whereas occupancy rate of smaller patches was only 12%. The preference still existed in landscapes dominated by grasslands, although the difference was not as dramatic: 50% in large patches, 40% in small patches (Bakker et al. 2002). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Grass-dominated fields, native prairie (Florida), and grazed pastures (Mexico and Belize) (Vickery 1996)."
Urspelerpes brucei,"Found in a linear distribution along the Atlantic coast in salt marshes dominated by cordgrass, saltmeadow grass, and blackgrass (Woolfenden 1956). Nests on ground under mat of grasses or several centimeters above wet ground in dense clump of grass (Byrd and Johnston 1991). Eighty percent of nests in a Rhode Island study were in high-marsh graminoids (DeRagon 1988)."
Accipiter cooperii,"BREEDING: Uses open, level uplands and lowlands, with tall, thick herbaceous vegetation and thick litter (Peabody 1901, Tester and Marshall 1961, Walkinshaw 1968, Murray 1969, Richter 1969). Wetlands, sedge meadows, prairie, grasslands within aspen parkland, planted cover (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program [CRP] fields, Permanent Cover Program [PCP] fields, and dense nesting cover [DNC]), hayfields, fallow fields, and idle pasture all support breeding populations (Peabody 1901; Walkinshaw 1937; Murray 1969; Richter 1969; Robbins 1969; Stewart 1975; Renken 1983; Cooper 1984; Niemi 1985; Renken and Dinsmore 1987; Dale 1993; Dhol et al. 1994; Hartley 1994; Jones 1994; Igl and Johnson 1995, 1999; Igl 1996; Prescott and Murphy 1995, 1996; Dale et al. 1997, McMaster and Davis 1998). Many species of tall, dense, native and tame grasses, sedges (CAREX), rushes (JUNCUS), and forbs can provide suitable habitat (Peabody 1901, Walkinshaw 1968, Murray 1969, Faanes 1981, Renken 1983, Cooper 1984, Niemi 1985; Renken and Dinsmore 1987, Dale 1993, Jones 1994, Madden 1996). Prefer areas with dense litter for nesting cover (Tester and Marshall 1961, Madden 1996). <br><br>In Minnesota and North Dakota, bred in hummocky alkali fens, tallgrass prairie, wet-meadow zones of wetlands, tame hayfields, and retired cropland (Johnsgard 1979). Nested on the ground in dense herbaceous vegetation, usually in the drier borders of wetlands. Although nested among scattered small willows (SALIX) in Minnesota and Michigan, they seemed to prefer areas free of shrubs and other woody vegetation (Peabody 1901, Walkinshaw 1968, Robbins 1969, Madden 1996). In North Dakota, were associated with a high amount of grass cover, especially broad-leaved, introduced grasses (Madden 1996). <br><br>Habitat use varies widely by region and yearly moisture conditions. In Montana, singing sparrows were observed in extensive wet meadows (Davis 1952). In North Dakota, Minnesota, and the Canadian prairie provinces, used freshwater wetlands and low wet prairie (Murray 1969). In Minnesota, three of 15 nests found were located in upland grasslands (Peabody 1901). More recent studies have found breeding evidence in drier upland areas. In Wisconsin and Minnesota, nested in dry upland grasslands, as well as in fallow fields near wetlands (Robbins 1969, Cooper 1984). In CRP fields in the northern Great Plains, occurred in both damp, low areas and dry, upland areas (Igl and Johnson 1995, 1999). In North Dakota, low, wet areas were optimal breeding habitat, but also nested in domestic hayfields and retired cropland (Stewart 1975). <br><br>In aspen parkland in Saskatchewan and Alberta, were not observed in cropland, including fallow cropland (Dale 1993, Hartley 1994, Prescott and Murphy 1995). In North Dakota, singing males were observed in small-grain fields that were CRP the previous year (L.D. Igl and D.H. Johnson, unpubl. data). Presence in these small-grain fields, however, may have been an expression of site fidelity to a previous breeding site. In Manitoba, were not detected in cropland (Jones 1994). In Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, occurred more frequently in PCP grasslands than in cropland (McMaster and Davis 1998). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Variety of old field and prairie habitats with dense cover of grass or sedge. Examples include: moist fields of broomsedge, rice stubble, airfield grasslands, and damp weedy or grassy fields (Lowther 1996)."
Accipiter striatus,"BREEDING: A habitat specialist that occupies coastal tidal marshes throughout its range (Kale 1983, Robbins 1983). One (A. M. MIRABILIS) population in Florida commonly occurs in freshwater MUHLENBERGIA (M. FILIPES, a tussock grass) prairie (Werner and Woolfenden 1983), and another near Charleston, South Carolina, evidently avoids the outer coastal marshes for breeding and uses brackish, more sheltered marshes away from the coast (Sprunt and Chamberlain 1970). Northeastern birds occupy both high marsh (dominated by salt meadow vegetation including salt-meadow grass (SPARTINA PATENS), black-grass (JUNCUS GERARDI), glasswort (SALICORNIA spp.), and marsh elder (IVA FRUTESCENS)), and low marsh (mainly various ecological forms of smooth cordgrass (SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA)) habitats (Woolfenden 1956, Post 1970, 1970, 1974, Reinert et al. 1981, Greenlaw 1983, Marshall and Reinert 1990). Descriptions of habitat elsewhere in the range can be found in Nicholson (1928, 1946), Tomkins (1941), Sprunt and Chamberlain (1970), Werner (1975), Sykes (1980), Post (1981), Kale (1983), Post et al. (1983), and Werner and Woolfenden (1983). <br><br>A patchy or discontinuous distribution on local marshes is exhibited throughout the range. The composition and physiognomic characteristics of occupied marsh vegetation are varied and reflect a behavioral opportunism in using available substrate (Greenlaw 1983, Post et al. 1983). Two biologically significant habitat characteristics evidently shared by most or all breeding populations are: (1) suitable elevated nest sites that offer protection from periodic tidal and storm-related flooding, and (2) nearby openings in the vegetation, or pool and ditch edges that permit access to the bases of rooted plants and open mud during foraging (Greenlaw 1992). Different microhabitats fulfill these divergent requirements for nesting and feeding. In low marshes in New York and New England, nests are commonly in areas of medium-height cordgrass (40-100 cm) growing densely enough to form a turf of partly clumped, semi-erect, persistent stems in the spring. Stands of dwarf cordgrass at or near mean high water level, and tall, open stands in the lower intertidal zone are avoided as nesting substrates. In high marshes, sparrows nest on IVA-dominated spoil deposits, or in IVA/salt meadow ecotones on the inner marsh, but they shun extensive areas of pure salt meadow grasses. Optimum habitat contains nesting and feeding microhabitats in close proximity, otherwise sparrows commute between a nest-centered territory and more distant undefended (but see DeRagon 1988) feeding areas (Tomkins 1941, Woolfenden 1956, Post 1974, Greenlaw 1983, 1992, Post et al. 1983, Marshall 1986, DeRagon 1988, Marshall and Reinert 1990). <br><br>NEST SITES: Typically elevated high enough in suitable vegetation to minimize the problem of normal flooding and low enough to be sheltered from predators and weather (Woolfenden 1956, Greenlaw 1983, Post et al. 1983, DeRagon 1988, Marshall and Reinert 1990). In New York, mid-summer nests suspended in new-growth cordgrass averaged 19.0 cm above the mud (Post 1974). Early nests are typically placed in clumps of residual cordgrass, but later nests are in the vegetation column between erect, live culms of cordgrass (Post 1974, Marshall and Reinert 1990). In the latter case, the tops of the grasses are often pulled over the nest to form a canopy (Greenlaw, pers. obs.). Occasionally, nests are placed one to four m above the ground in a shrub (usually IVA spp. in the Northeast) or small tree (Arnow 1906, Woolfenden 1956, Marshall 1986, Greenlaw 1992). In Florida, the activity of predatory rats influences nest site use by sparrows (Post 1981). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Populations along the southeastern Atlantic and Gulf coasts are nonmigratory and continue to occupy their breeding marshes during the nonbreeding season. In some of these populations, there may be local or regional dispersal as birds respond to seasonal changes in food. Near Charleston, South Carolina, young leave the brackish, subcoastal, breeding marshes shortly after they are able to fly and move into the outer coastal marshes (Sprunt and Chamberlain 1970). In New York, post-breeding birds frequent the tall stands of cordgrass along the bay edges where they harvest the rich supply of seed (Greenlaw 1992). Beyond the fact that the birds remain in tidal marshes during the winter, little is known about the characteristics of the wintering habitat of northeastern sparrows."
Actitis macularius,"BREEDING: Freshwater marshes and wet meadows in interior and brackish marshes along coast (AOU 1995). Nests on ground in matted bed of rushes or under mat of grasses, in dense grass or sedges, or several centimeters above wet ground in dense clump of grass (Terres 1980, Byrd and Johnston 1991). <br><br>Prefers freshwater wetlands with dense, emergent vegetation or damp areas with dense grasses (Bownan 1904, Murray 1969, Stewart 1975, Krapu and Green 1978, Knapton 1979, Williams and Zimmer 1992, Berkey et al. 1993). Suitable habitat includes fens, wet meadows, peatlands, lake margins with emergent cattails (TYPHA spp.), native prairie, idle fields, and planted cover (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program lands and dense nesting cover [DNC]), but habitat use may vary annually depending on moisture conditions (Bownan 1904; Breckenridge and Kilgore 1929; Roberts 1932; Hill 1968; Stewart 1975; Salt and Salt 1976; Knapton 1979; Renken 1983; Johnson and Schwartz 1993; Hartley 1994a,b; Prescott and Murphy 1995; Prescott et al. 1995). <br><br>Nests usually are built in stands of grasses with litter that is persistent from year to year (Greenlaw and Rising 1994). Nests are built on or slightly above the ground in damp areas among emergent vegetation (Murray 1969, Stewart 1975). In North Dakota, are more abundant in dry years than in wet years (Stewart 1975). In dry years, nest in the shallow-marsh and deep-marsh zones of wetlands; in wet years, nest in cordgrass (SPARTINA) within wet-meadow zones. <br><br>Breeding populations in fens are restricted to areas dominated by cattail, reed (PHRAGMITES), and softstem bulrush (SCIRPUS VALIDUS); species that provide nesting cover within shallow-marsh and deep-marsh zones include cattail, hardstem bulrush (SCIRPUS ACUUnrankable S), river bulrush (SCIRPUS FLUVIATILIS), alkali bulrush (SCIRPUS MARITIMUS), sprangletop (SCOLOCHLOA FESUnrankable CACEA), sloughgrass (BECKMANNIA), slough sedge (CAREX ATHERODES), and marsh smartweed (POLYGONUM AMPHIBIUM). In North Dakota, were common in prairie cordgrass (SPARTINA PECTINATA) stands, occurred at the edges of common reed (PHRAGMITES AUSTRALIS) stands, and nested in sprangletop (Murray 1969). In northeastern North Dakota, nested in thin, sparse grass on a wet alkali flat (Rolfe 1899, Hill 1968). They were found nesting in bulrushes (SCIRPUS) and dense grass in South Dakota (Williams and Zimmer 1992). In Alberta, abundances in mixed-grass prairie were similar to those in tame grasslands (Prescott et al. 1995). In Minnesota and Canada, nested in wetlands located in wooded areas (Breckenridge 1930, Salt and Wilk 1958, Salt and Salt 1976). In Minnesota, Breckenridge and Kilgore (1929) observed nesting in vegetation above damp soil on the edge of a 500 hectare wetland dominated by moss (SPHAGNUM) and sedge (CAREX). Another Minnesota study found that graminoid density near nests was high (more than 190 stems per square meter) (Hanowski and Niemi 1986, 1988). Stem density of phanerophytes (graminoids, forbs, or shrubs more than 40 centimeters tall that are present each year) was low (median of 0.02 stems per square meter) in habitats used by Nelson's Sharp-tailed Sparrows (Hanowski and Niemi 1986). The most common forbs near nests were mints (LAMIACEAE); the phanerophytes comprised broad-leaved cattails (TYPHA LATIFOLIA) and willows (SALIX SPP.). Nests in northwestern Minnesota were in wetlands surrounded by bands of tamarack (LARIX LARICINA), thickets of aspen (POPULUS), and patches of tallgrass (Breckenridge 1930). In the St. Croix River Valley of Minnesota and Wisconsin used northern sedge meadows containing mannagrass (GLYCERIA), bluejoint (CALAMAGROSTIS CANADENSIS), and water sedge (CAREX AQUATILIS) (Faanes 1981). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: in migration in wet fields and marshes (Rising 1996). In winter in freshwater and saltwater marshes, but predominantly in brackish and salt marshes (AOU 1995, Rising 1996)."
Aegolius acadicus,"BREEDING: Lakes, rivers, marshes and ponds in grasslands, barrens, dry tundra, open boreal forest or cultivated fields. Most breeding associated with seasonal and semipermanent wetlands (Suchy and Anderson 1987). Often nests near freshwater lakes and ponds, but may nest some distance from water. Readily uses stock-watering ponds in North Dakota (Suchy and Anderson 1987); uses all sorts of man-made ponds in Quebec (Belanger and Couture 1989). May nest under cover of low vegetation or in open. Broods use emergent vegetation for escape cover. Nest is a depression lined with plant material and down. NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter in both fresh-water and brackish situations (AOU 1983); prefers shallow, open freshwater lagoons, marshes, and slough in Costa Rica (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Agelaius phoeniceus,"Freshwater ponds, marshes, shallow edges of lakes; also, in migration and winter, shallow salt and brackish water and shores (Godfrey 1966). Nests in prairie pothole country and elsewhere. Usually nests in areas with dense emergent vegetation; on islands, lake edges, sometimes in upland habitat some distance from water. Nest is a depression lined with plant material, down, feathers."
Aix sponsa,"Primarily shallow waters such as ponds, lakes, marshes, and flooded fields; in migration and in winter mostly in fresh water and cultivated fields, less commonly in brackish situations (AOU 1983). See Nichols et al. (1983). Adapted to dynamic wetland conditions that provide a variety of wetland types in relatively close proximity (Allen 1986, which see for details on winter habitat in Lower Mississippi Valley). In Maryland, breeding pairs and broods used stormwater-control basins, especially permanent ponds with gently sloping sides (Adams et al. 1985). In California and Oregon, molting areas were dominated by bulrush and cattail and were traditionally flooded in summer and often associated with lakes or rivers (Yarris et al. 1994). Usually nests on ground in concealing vegetation, sometimes in trees or in atypical situations. Nest usually within 0.8 km of water (Palmer 1976). Commonly uses man-made ponds. Successful nesters are more likely to return to the same nesting site in successive years than are unsuccessful nesters."
Ammodramus savannarum,"Shallow margins of lakes, streams, bays mud flats, and open waters. Nests in both dry and wet woodlands. Wide variety of wetland habitats in both freshwater and marine situations, in and around marshes, swamps, ponds, lakes, bays, estuaries, and tidal flats. As a result of a study of postfledging habitat use, Frazer et al. (1990) recommended maintaining large (30-50 ha) marshes containing dense emergent vegetation near a complex of diverse wetland types. BREEDING: Breeding habitat and nest sites very diverse; favors wooded swamps and marshes, brackish or freshwater. In central Ontario, preferred small fertile wetlands with a moderate amount of open water and an irregular shoreline (Merendino and Ankney 1994). Usually nests on ground in concealing vegetation, rarely in abandoned tree nest of other bird species. Significant numbers may return to the natal home range to breed."
Ammospiza caudacuta,"Freshwater swamps, lakes, and sluggish streams at low elevations and, in tropical regions, primarily around brackish lagoons and in mangroves (AOU 1983). In Louisiana, most nesting areas are freshwater, some brackish; mainly cypress swamps, sometimes in freshwater marshes (Portnoy, cited by Johnsgard 1993). Favored habitats have areas of open nonturbid water (Palmer 1962). Nests near top of tree or shrub 1-6 m above water or ground, often near wading birds and cormorants. Male establishes nest site, both sexes build."
Ammospiza leconteii,"In migration and winter, inhabits wetlands, grainfields, grassy fields, marshes, lakes and ponds. Breeds on arctic tundra on edge of marshes, lakes, sloughs, rivers. May nest on islands, on hillsides near open water, or on hummocks in bogs. Female scrapes out depression and lines it with grasses and down."
Ammospiza maritima,"Winters in both freshwater and coastal wetlands, wet prairies and extensive sandbars, foraging also in pastures, cultivated lands and flooded fields (AOU 1983). Nests in tundra marshes near water, on raised hummocks and ridges. In Manitoba, geese nesting in tall willows had better reproductive success than did geese nesting in shorter willows or in areas without willows (Jackson et al. 1988). Females generally nest at their natal or prior nest site."
Ammospiza maritima macgillivraii,"Nonbreeding: seacoasts, beaches, mudflats, wet meadows, sandy areas and cultivated fields (AOU 1983). Nests in tundra, rocky talus slopes, and alpine meadows. Nests on the ground under cover of or next to tussock or hummock, or hidden near a rock or bank recess. The nest is a shallow scrape that may contain nest material."
Ammospiza nelsoni,"Breeding habitat includes short-grass plains, mixed grass prairie, alkaline meadows, and wet meadows. This species is found in grasslands with mid-height vegetation, including upland mixed-grass prairie, alkaline meadows, and wet meadow zones around alkali and freshwater lakes (Stewart 1975; Dryer, pers. comm.). <br /><br />Near Welby, Saskatchewan, Sprague's pipit bred in a shortgrass prairie that had not been grazed for at least seven years (Harris 1983). The plant cover included 28% bare ground with litter, 10.8% needle and thread grass (<i>Stipa comata</i>), 9.4% prairie selaginella (<i>Selaginella densa</i>), 6.9% alkali grass (<i>Distichlis stricta</i>), 6.6% june grass (<i>Koeleria cristata</i>) and various forbs. At Cross Ranch Nature Preserve in North Dakota, Berkey (1983) found 0.12 singing males/hectare in a mixed grass prairie in which the ground cover consisted of 75% grasses and sedges, 15% shrubs and 10% forbs. On a lowland mixed-grass prairie at Cross Ranch, there were 0.15 singing males/hectare. The ground cover on this prairie was 80% grasses and sedges, 15% forbs and 5% woody shrubs (Berkey 1983). This species also occurs in alkaline meadows with slender wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron caninum</i>), fowl bluegrass (<i>Poa palustris</i>), northern reedgrass (<i>Calamagrostis inexpansa</i>), Baltic rush (<i>Juncus balticus</i>) and fescue sedge (<i>Carex brevior</i>) and in wet meadows with saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>), alkali grass and wild barley (Stewart 1975). <br /><br />No studies have measured the vegetation density of breeding habitats, but some qualitative assessments have been made. Berkey (pers. comm.) found high densities in flat, saline areas dominated by sparse stands of foxtail (<i>Setaria </i>sp.) three to six in (7.6-15.2 cm) high in North Dakota, and an observer in Montana noted that the birds commonly occur in areas of sparse grass (Kantrud 1981). On the other hand, Kantrud and Kologiski (1982) commented that early ornithologists found breeding pipits in dense vegetation in the northern Great Plains of the U.S. There is some evidence of shifts from upland areas to wetter habitats in dry years. In the Sheyenne Lake region of central North Dakota during 1980, a dry year, most of the birds were found in wet meadows, with just a few in the usual nesting habitat of upland native prairie (Faanes 1982). This species seems to tolerate some disturbed grasslands. <br /><br />Habitat during migration and in winter consists of pastures and weedy fields (AOU 1983), including grasslands with dense herbaceous vegetation or grassy agricultural fields."
Anas acuta,"Breeding habitat includes open grasslands, marshes, marshy edges of lakes and ponds, and river banks (Terres 1980). Nests are on the ground or in shallow water on open tundra, large marshes, bogs, fens, or wet forest meadows. Individuals exhibit high fidelity to breeding territories (see Littlefield 1995). During the nonbreeding season, sandhill cranes roost at night in shallow water along river channels, on alluvial islands of braided rivers, or in natural basin wetlands. A communal roost site consisting of an open expanse of shallow water is a key feature of wintering habitat (California Department of Fish and Game 1990). Along the North Platte River in spring, roosts are generally in shallow water (&lt; 20 cm), 11-50 m from the nearest visual obstruction, and away from paved or gravel roads, single dwellings, and bridges (Norling et al. 1992). See also Folk and Tacha (1990) for a description of roost site characteristics in the North Platte River Valley. Cranes migrating in spring through interior Alaska often roost on river overflow ice of the Tanana River or on the ice of ponds and lakes (Johnsgard 1991). Feeding and resting often occur in fields and agricultural lands."
Anas crecca,"BREEDING: Deciduous forest, pine-oak association, live-oak groves, and edges of clearings (AOU 1983, 1998). Dry or mesic woods and forests with either pine or hardwood, though favors mixed woods and a light to moderate understory (Hamel 1992). Forages over fields and clearings (Hamel 1992). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: also in open woodland, scrub, palmetto thickets, and tropical evergreen forest (AOU 1983, 1998), old second growth, tall hedgerows in savannas and croplands, thickets at forest edge or at gaps inside forest (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Anas platyrhynchos,"BREEDING: Forest and open woodland, from lowland moist and deciduous forest to montane forest and pine-oak association (AOU 1983). In open woodlands with well spaced trees and a low canopy. Uncommon in mature forest; prefers even-aged successional habitats from regeneration to pole-stage stands (Bushman and Therres 1988). Rests on ground or on branch, in thicket at forest edge, in hedgerow or gallery forest (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Lays eggs on ground in open site under trees or under bush, usually on a bed of dead leaves (Harrison 1978) at woods edge or in open woodland. Breeds primarily in montane habitats in tropics (AOU 1983)."
Anas rubripes,"Golden eagles generally inhabit open and semi-open country such as prairies, sagebrush, arctic and alpine tundra, savannah or sparse woodland, and barren areas, especially in hilly or mountainous regions, in areas with sufficient mammalian prey base and near suitable nesting sites. In Nevada, the only habitats routinely avoided by golden eagles are forests, large agricultural areas, and urban areas (GBBO 2010).<br><br>Nests are most often on rock ledges of cliffs but sometimes in large trees (e.g., oak or eucalytus in California, white pine in eastern North America), on steep hillsides, or on the ground. Nesting cliffs may face any direction and may be close to or distant from water. In Elko County, Nevada, 93 percent of nests were on cliffs, 71 percent were at elevations between 5,000 feet and 6,500 feet, and 43 percent faced east; 84 percent of nests were within two miles of water with desert riparian habitat (Page and Seibert 1973).<br><br>A pair may have multiple alternate nests; the pair may use the same or alternate nests in consecutive years."
Anhinga anhinga,"Swampy forest, marshes, mangroves. Open freshwater marshes, pond and river margins, occasionally wooded swamps (Stiles and Skutch 1989). <br><br>Nests in sawgrass or loose mass of leaves just above water, in vines growing over shrubs along streams, or in bushes or trees along deeper streams (Terres 1980)."
Anser albifrons,"Breeding habitat includes both heavily wooded and open deciduous, mixed pine-hardwood, or pine forests, forest edge, savannas, wetlands, orchards, parks, wooded yards, and gardens (Cadman et al. 1987, Jackson et al. 1996, Johnston and Odum 1956, Oberholser 1974, Palmer-Ball 1996, Robinson et al. 1996, Weidensaul et al. 2013). Nests are typically near the tip of a downward-sloping branch, 0.5-15 meters above the ground or water and are often sheltered overhead by leaves but open below (Robinson et al. 1996, Weidensaul et al. 2013). During migration, these hummingbirds use habitats similar in structure to those used for breeding. Winter habitat includes brushy second growth, deciduous forest, tropical dry forest, tropical deciduous forest, gallery forest, shade trees in coffee plantations and yards, flowering hedges, and citrus groves (Stiles and Skutch 1989, Mills and Rogers 1992, Robinson et al. 1996, Weidensaul et al. 2013)."
Anser caerulescens,"Marshes, swampy woods, tidal estuaries, lagoons, mangroves, streams, lakes, and ponds; also fields and meadows. <br><br>Nests primarily in tall trees, usually with other colonial water birds; in woods or thickets near water. See Spendelow and Patton (1988) for further details and information on geographic variation in nesting habitat. Returns to the same colony sites year after year."
Anthus rubescens,"Freshwater and brackish marshes, along lakes, rivers, bays, lagoons, ocean beaches, mangroves, fields, and meadows. Nests commonly high in trees in swamps and forested areas, less commonly in bushes, or on ground, rock ledges, and coastal cliffs. Often nests with other herons. See Spendelow and Patton (1988) for further details and discussion of geographic variation in nesting sites. Generally nests close to foraging habitat."
Anthus spragueii,Pelagic. Nests in burrows on oceanic islands.
Antigone canadensis,"Pelagic. In spring and summer off California, concentrates in relatively shallow, cool waters, especially where strong thermal gradients mark the edge of upwellings (Briggs and Chu 1986). Nests in burrows on islands."
Antigone canadensis pratensis,"Nonbreeding: rocky, barren pebbly coasts, sandy beaches, mud flats, river mouths, tidal creeks, and shores of lakes (AOU 1983); fields (Shallenberger 1984). Nests in dry, dwarf-shrub tundra, usually near water (AOU 1983); various habitats ranging from wet mud or barren peat to dense vegetation, though appears to favor barren habitats (see Johnson and Herter 1989). Usually breeds along the coast. Nests on the ground; may nest near other ruddy turnstones."
Antigone canadensis tabida,"BREEDING: Broad expanses of open land with low vegetation for nesting and foraging are required. Habitat types frequently mentioned as suitable include fresh and saltwater marshes, bogs, dunes, prairies, grassy plains, old fields, tundra, moorlands, river valleys, meadows, savanna, open woodland, and heathland (Dement'ev et al. 1951, Clark 1975, Mikkola 1983, Holt and Melvin 1986). In general, any area that is large enough, has low vegetation with some dry upland for nesting, and that supports suitable prey may be considered potential breeding habitat, although many will not have breeding short-eared owls. Dement'ev and Gladkov (1951) assert that ""nearby water"" is a requirement for nesting habitat. Roosts by day on ground, on low open perch, under low shrub, or in conifer. Reported from ""forest"" habitats in Hawaii. <br><br>Nests on ground, generally in slight depression (Terres 1980), often beside or beneath a bush or clump of grass. Many nests are near water but generally are on dry sites. In coastal Massachusetts, nested in secondary herbaceous grass/sand dune vegetation dominated by <i>Ammophila</i> (Holt 1992). Same nest site may be used in successive years. Moves into and breeds in areas with high rodent densities. <br><br>Generally nest on high ground or upland sites (Pitelka et al. 1955; Clark 1975; Holt and Melvin 1986; Tate and Melvin 1987, 1988; Combs and Melvin 1989). Urner (1925) reported nests in a saltmarsh, one of which was subsequently flooded by a high tide, but in general, drier sites are preferred. During five years of study on Nantucket and Tuckernuck islands, all 41 nests found were in dry upland areas, though wetter sites were available (Holt and Melvin 1986; Tate and Melvin 1987, 1988; Combs and Melvin 1989; Combs and Griffin 1990). Eight nest sites at Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge, east of Nantucket, found between 1982 and 1985, were also all on dry upland sites (Holt and Melvin 1986). <br><br>Using a line-intercept technique (Brower and Zar 1977, Holt and Melvin 1986), vegetation characteristics of 15 nest sites on Nantucket were evaluated in 1986 and 1987. This analysis showed that low dense shrubs, mainly black huckleberry (<i>Gaylussacia baccata</i>) and bayberry (<i>Myrica pennsylvanica</i>), that were less than 0.5 m comprised 40.4%, and high dense shrubs (same species, >= 0.5 m) comprised 37.14% of the cover within five meters of the nest (Tate and Melvin 1987, 1988). Other vegetation included low sparse shrubs (11.1%), low dense grass (8.1%), and high dense grass (3.0%, mostly <i>Andropogon scoparius</i> and <i>Ammophila breviligulata</i>). These data demonstrate that in choosing nest sites on Nantucket, dense shrub cover is usually sought. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Suitable breeding habitat may also be occupied by wintering birds. Conversely, Clark (1975) noted two occasions when winter territories became breeding territories. Short-eared owls tend to congregate and roost communally in the winter (Banfield 1947, Craighead and Craighead 1956, Clark 1975), often in sheltered sites near hunting areas. Winter roosts have been reported in abandoned dumps, quarries, gravel pits, storage yards, stump piles, old fields, small evergreen groves, bayberry thickets, dunes, and open, abandoned cellars (Clark 1975, Bosakowski 1986). May also roost directly on the ground in tall grasses, possibly choosing vegetation of a coloration that blends with their plumage (Craighead and Craighead 1956). <br><br>In winter the ground roosting habit may be abandoned for trees, possibly in response to deep snow (Banfield 1947, Bosakowski 1986). Smith (1989) noted drastic decreases in numbers of short- eared owls at known winter roosts on Point Peninsula in Jefferson County, New York, after a heavy snowfall created deep cover."
Antrostomus carolinensis,"Deciduous and evergreen forests, orchards, wooded parks, farm woodlots, river woods, desert oases. Wooded areas with dense vegetation needed for roosting and nesting, open areas for hunting. Often associated with conifers in eastern North America, also with deciduous woods near water in West. <br><br>Nests in tree usually in old nest of crow, squirrel, hawk, magpie, or heron; sometimes in tree cavity; rarely on ground (e.g., Maples et al. 1995, Wilson Bull. 107:563-565). In northeastern Oregon, nested in dwarf-mistletoe brooms in Douglas-fir in extensive conifer (grand fir) forest (Bull et al. 1989). Apparently commonly nests in same site in successive years. In Idaho, 4 males nested 0.5-1.5 km from natal site."
Antrostomus vociferus,"BREEDING: Marshes, ponds, and small lakes (AOU 1998). Usually nests near small ponds and lakes, sedge meadows, creeks; in cover 1-2 ft high, within 46 m of water. Often nest on islands among colonies of gulls or terns. NON-BREEDING: During migration and when not breeding, found along coast in sheltered bays, estuaries, and marshes or inland on lakes, ponds, and rivers; on salt water especially if lakes and ponds frozen. In southern winter range, prefers freshwater ponds, lakes, and sloughs with reasonably clear water 1 m or more deep (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Aquila chrysaetos,"Large marshes, lakes, lagoons, rivers and bays, wintering mostly in brackish and marine lagoons and bays, less frequently in inland fresh-water situations (AOU 1983). Birds arriving in fall on saltwater wintering areas, and those wintering in high salinity areas, generally make daily flights to nearby freshwater ponds to drink, preen, and bathe (but not to feed) (Custer 1993). <br><br>The most important breeding areas are concentrated in the prairies of the U.S. and Canada. Nests in large freshwater marshes (semipermanently and seasonally flooded palustrine wetlands with persistent emergent vegetation; optimum nesting conditions are wetlands that are 2 ha or more and not more than 0.4 km from a large permanent or semipermanent lake; nests usually are placed in dense bulrush or cattail stands that are interspersed with small areas of open water; nests usually are within 3-4 m of open water; bottom of nest usually is 4-24 cm above the water (Custer 1993). Broods use shallow ponds if emergent vegetation is available for escape cover; ideally these should have high invertebrate populations; later, access to deeper water with ample pondweeds is important (Custer 1993). After nesting, many move to large lakes to molt (Custer 1993). Commonly deposits eggs in nests of other waterfowl species."
Aramus guarauna,"Marshes, lakes, rivers, swamps, especially in wooded areas. Winters primarily on freshwater and brackish situations of larger lakes, rivers, and estuaries (AOU 1983); prefers deep open water (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Sleeps by day near emergent vegetation by lakeshores (Madge and Burn 1988). Birds close to the coast may spend their nights out at sea but come in at dawn to feed in fresh water (Root 1988). In Minnesota, ducklings spent most of time in open water, used islands of decayed vegetation for resting (Wilson Bull. 104:472-484). Nests at margins of small ponds, sloughs, bogs, and marshes."
Archilochus colubris,"In migration and winter, found in bays, estuaries, and large open inland lakes and rivers. <br><br>Breeds near shores of ponds and lakes, in marshes, or on islands, primarily in forested tundra and northern borders of the taiga; among grass or shrubs, or under spruce boughs. The nest is a hollow lined with plant material, down and feathers."
Ardea alba,"Marshes, ponds, lakes, rivers and bays. Winters on deep, freshwater lakes and rivers as well as on sheltered bays and estuaries (AOU 1983). <br><br>Nests in emergent vegetation in freshwater marshes, including those bordering lakes, ponds, or rivers; study in Manitoba indicated need for secure nesting site in a diversified wetland complex containing a variety of size, permanency, and cover types (favored different conditions for acitivities such as nesting, feeding, and brood rearing) (Stoudt 1982). Sometimes nests on old muskrat house or on dry ground. Females typically breed in their natal area."
Ardea herodias,"Forest, woodland, scrub, and partly open situations with scattered trees, from deciduous and mixed woodland in the northeast to oak-juniper scrub, mesquite, and riparian woodland in the southwest; also wooded parks and residential areas (AOU 1998). Nests in natural cavity in tree, or in old woodpecker hole, or in artificial cavity such as pipe, bird box, 1-27 m above ground (Harrison 1978)."
Ardenna gravis,"BREEDING: Restricted primarily to extensive, open tracts of short grassland habitat. Nest in native prairie, dry meadows, pastures, domestic hayfields, short-grass savanna, plowed fields, along highway rights-of-way and on airfields, and (in the north) peatlands and scattered woodlands near timberline (Forbush 1925, Higgins et al. 1969, AOU 1983, Osborne and Peterson 1984, Godfrey 1986). Nesting is also known to occur in dry patches of wet meadows (Stewart 1975, Herman et al. 1984) and in blueberry (VACCINIUM spp.) barrens (J. Albright, pers. comm.). A survey of nesting habitats in Wisconsin (White 1983) suggests that upland sandpipers favor a level topography with a minimum of tall vegetation edges and proportionately high acreages of agricultural crops which duplicate prairie grasslands in terms of structure. <br><br>Preferred habitat includes large areas of short grass for feeding and courtship with interspersed or adjacent taller grasses for nesting and brood cover; in the northeastern U.S., airfields currently provide the majority of suitable habitat, though grazed pastures and grassy fields also are used (Carter 1992). Nests on ground among grasses; sometimes along prairie sloughs (Terres 1980). <br><br>The quality of a particular habitat is best indicated by the total number of birds present during May and June. Observations by Buss and Hawkins (1939) suggest a delicate distinction between acceptable and unacceptable sites. A slight change in an accepted field may cause it to become unacceptable, i.e., heavy or early grazing, standing water, burning, and manuring may reduce or exclude nesting from fields accepted the previous year. Abandoned fields with invading shrubs and trees may sometimes exclude upland sandpipers (Laughlin and Kibbe 1985), although at a site in Massachusetts, they nest in fields with scattered shrubs and one to two m tall pine trees (PINUS spp.) (White and Melvin 1985). <br><br>Airports and airfields offer excellent habitat for breeding colonies, providing level expanses of short grass fields attractive to upland sandpipers. Nesting surveys in the mid-1980s in Ohio (Osborne and Peterson 1984) and in Massachusetts (White and Melvin 1985) showed that airport habitats in these states were utilized over all other habitats with respect to the number of sites and number of individuals per site. The short grassy strips along runways and taxiways are used for feeding, loafing, nesting, brood-rearing and pre-migratory flocking. Upland sandpipers are believed to pose little threat to aircraft at airports because of their small size, typical behavioral patterns, and tendency to remain mostly on the ground. Flight is usually low and direct (White and Melvin 1985). <br><br>Vegetation height is an important factor in the selection of nesting sites (Kirsch and Higgins 1976). Nesting studies by Ailes (1980) in Wisconsin recorded 54% of nests in cover between 25-40 cm in height, not exceeding 70 cm at the time of egg hatching. In North Dakota nesters were found in cover between 15.5-30.8 cm in height, and appeared to avoid cover over 61.5 cm (Kirsch and Higgins 1976). White and Melvin (1985) reported that vegetation surrounding six active nests located on a Massachusetts airfield ranged from 8.0-25.0 cm in height. <br><br>Agricultural land use patterns and farming practices influence the choice of nesting sites. In central Wisconsin, Ailes (1980) found that idle fields and hayfields accounted for the majority of nesting habitats. Nesting studies in North and South Dakota indicated the majority of nests were in ungrazed grasslands of medium density with abundant ground litter (Higgins et al. 1969). A five-year survey (1969-74) of intensively cultivated areas in the prairie pothole region of east-central North Dakota recorded 57% of nests in untilled habitats, which comprised only 7% of the total study area (Higgins 1975). In Illinois, Buhnerkempe and Westemeir (1988) reported that sandpipers selected stands of grass and forbs for nesting and avoided fields of uniform grass and legumes. <br><br>In North Dakota, Kirsch and Higgins (1976) recorded their lowest mean nest densities in annually tilled croplands and their highest mean nest densities in native grasslands the second season after a prescribed burn. Seeded grass/legume mixtures generally grew too tall and dense. Kirsch and Higgins (1976) found that the majority of North Dakota nests were located in either thin, uniform vegetative cover or in scattered clumps of fairly dense cover characterized by standing stubble fields, moderately grazed pastures, mowed areas with heavy regrowth, brush clumps with some understory vegetation, and undisturbed vegetation on poor soils. Residual vegetation from the previous growing seasons accounted for 25% of the cover at 54% of sandpiper nests. <br><br>Upland sandpipers use grassy fields of low vegetation height for feeding and brood rearing. Ailes (1980) observed 66% of adults with young in Wisconsin in grazed pastures, 13% in ungrazed pastures, and 11% in hayfields. Ailes (1980) found a large percentage of adults with young in Wisconsin in heavily grazed fields with vegetation ranging from zero to ten cm in height. Buhnerkempe and Westemeir (1988) reported that, in Illinois, they selected brood habitats of wheat stubble fields, recently hayed legumes, old redtop meadows (AGROSTIS spp.), and moderately grazed pastures. A South Dakota grasslands management study showed habitat use (nesting was not documented) to be highest in recently burned fields with short, open, new growth and no litter or old growth (Huber and Steuter 1984). <br><br>Upland sandpipers accept a variety of native and introduced grasses (Buss and Hawkins 1939). Timothy (PHLEUM spp.), bluegrass (POA spp.), needlegrass (STIPA spp.), bluestem (ANDROPOGON spp.), quackgrass (AGROPYRON spp.), Junegrass (KOELERA spp.), and bromegrass (BROMUS spp.) are among the grasses associated with nesting fields (Buss and Hawkins 1939, Meanley 1943, Buss 1951, Higgins et al. 1969, Kirsch and Higgins 1976, Ailes 1980). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Very rarely in migration along shores and mudflats (AOU 1983). On wintering grounds in South America, have been observed in pastures of remote estancias (Wetmore 1927), harvested and burnt-over canefields, football fields, airfields (Haverschmidt 1966), and on sandy beaches where the vegetation is open or recently burned (Spanns 1978). <br><br>Changes in land use and agricultural practices may be critical to the limited numbers (White 1988). In the province of Cordoba, Argentina, where the greatest numbers have been reported to date, native espinal (scrub trees) have been converted to dairy farms planted in pasture and alfalfa. Upland sandpipers possibly prefer the drier climate and planted grasses to historically utilized wetter, native grasslands found farther south and southeast (White 1988)."
Ardenna grisea,"A wide variety of open woodland types, either deciduous or coniferous, forest edge, second growth, parks, orchards and gardens; in migration and winter occurring wherever there are trees (AOU 1983). <br><br>Nests in tree or shrub, 2-15 m above ground, in fork or on outer horizontal limb (Terres 1980)."
Arenaria interpres,"Dense forest with some deciduous trees, in both wet and relatively dry situations from boreal forest (especially early seral stages dominated by aspen) and northern hardwood ecotone to eastern deciduous forest and oak-savanna woodland (AOU 1983). Young forest provides optimum conditions. See Crawford (1986) for additional information on habitat and cover requirements. Nests in forests or woodlands with some deciduous trees. Nest usually at base of tree, bush or stump. Drumming areas and broods usually in areas with high density of woody stems. Broods select habitats with abundant ground cover. In Wisconsin, females nested in areas in which they wintered following natal dispersal (Small and Rusch 1989)."
Asio flammeus,"BREEDING: Primarily large freshwater and (less often) brackish marshes, including lake and pond edges where cattails, sedges, or bulrushes are plentiful and marshes where there are patches of open water and aquatic-bed vegetation. Occurs also in other areas with dense herbaceous cover, such as shrubby marshes, bogs, wet meadows, and, rarely, hayfields (Brewer et al. 1991). Readily uses wetlands created by impoundments. Wetlands of 2.5 ha or more may support nesting; smaller wetlands may serve as alternate foraging sites (Gibbs and Melvin 1992). See Hanowski and Niemi (1990) for a quantitative study of habitat in Minnesota. <br><br>Nests primarily in inland freshwater wetlands, sometimes in tidal marshes or in sparsely vegetated wetlands or dry grassy uplands. Breeding occurs primarily in wetlands with tall emergent vegetation. Sparsely vegetated wetlands and dry grassy uplands are sometimes used, as are tidal marshes in some areas (Stewart and Robbins 1958, Swift 1987). In comparison to the sympatric least bittern (IXOBRYCHUS EXILIS), uses a wider variety of wetland cover types, less densely vegetated sites, shallower water depths, and primarily freshwater habitats. <br><br>Wetlands used in Maine were dominated by emergent and aquatic-bed (floating-leaved and submergent) vegetation, had a high diversity of vegetative life forms, and a high degree of cover/water interspersion (Gibbs et al. in press; Gibbs and Melvin 1990). Portions of wetlands used were dominated by sedges (CAREX spp.), broad-leaved cattail (TYPHA LATIFOLIA), and ericaceous shrubs. In a study of Quebec lakes, lakes with patches of floating-leaved plants, emergent growth along shorelines, and abundant amphibian populations were preferred (DesGranges and Houde 1989). <br><br>At Horicon Marsh in Wisconsin, responded to tape-recorded calls only from shallow water cattail and dry cattail habitats and seemed to avoid deepwater cattails (Manci and Rusch 1988). At moist soil impoundments in Missouri, associated with water depths of less than 10 cm and vegetative cover characterized as ""rank, dense, or sparse."" Habitat use was not associated with ""open"" or ""short"" vegetative cover or water of depths of greater than 10 cm (Fredrickson and Reid 1986). In Minnesota, seven breeding territories had a mean water depth of 10 cm, vegetation height of 1.3 m, and density of sedge and grass stems of 117 stems/m squared (Hanowski and Niemi 1986). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Migrant bitterns were flushed at 25 sites during spring in Missouri with mean water depth of 26 cm, vegetation height of 63 cm, and stem density of 157 stems/m squared. Characteristics of 35 flush sites in fall were similar, except that vegetation was taller (118 cm) (Reid 1989). In areas where temperatures stay above freezing and waters remain open, especially in coastal regions where the ocean moderates climate (Root 1988). Wintering habitat is much like breeding habitat, and overwintering populations are heavily dependent on managed wetland areas, such as those occurring at wildlife refuges (Root 1988). Occasionally occurs in habitats that are more open than the usual ones. Overwintering occasionally takes place in brackish coastal marshes (Hancock and Kushlan 1984)."
Asio otus,"Various habitats near water, from temperate regions to tundra. In migration and winter, coastal and freshwater marshes, lakes, rivers, fields, etc. On Admiralty Island, Alaska, commonly perches in trees. In the eastern U.S., common on lawns adjacent to water in urban-suburban areas. <br><br>Breeds in open or forested areas near lakes, ponds, large streams, inland and coastal marshes. The nest is built on the ground or on an elevated place (muskrat house, abandoned heron's nest, rocky cliffs, etc.) (Terres 1980). Usually returns to nesting territory used in previous year."
Aythya affinis,"Various forested habitats, moist or arid, deciduous or evergreen lowland forest to open temperate woodland, including second-growth forest, swamps, orchards, riverine forest, brushy hillsides, and desert. Very local in tropical lowlands (Hilty and Brown 1986). <br><br>Nest sites in different areas include: in trees in old or usurped nests of other birds (e.g., hawk, crow) or squirrel; tree cavities; stumps; rocky ledges; caves; in barns; and on artificial platforms. Usually in heaviest available timber in east; sites more diverse in arid west. Typically does not use same tree nest in successive years."
Aythya americana,"Wet pastureland and marshes, fresh water and brackish situations, dry fields, agricultural areas (especially irrigated ones), garbage dumps. In West Indies, roosts at night in mangrove swamps or on mangrove islands (Raffaele 1983). Nests in trees on islands in lakes; along watercourses; in swamps; on mangrove cays; near marshes. Usually nests with other herons or in single species colonies."
Aythya collaris,"BREEDING: Lakes, ponds, rivers and seacoasts (AOU 1983). Breeds in tree cavities in mixed coniferous-deciduous woodland near lakes and ponds (AOU 1983). Usually nests in natural tree cavities, or abandoned flicker holes. Females often nest in same site in successive years. NON-BREEDING: wintering on sheltered bays and estuaries as well as open freshwater situations (AOU 1983)."
Aythya marila,"Ponds, lakes, rivers and coastal bays, wintering primarily in bays and estuaries, less commonly on rivers and lakes (AOU 1983). Nests usually near pond, lake, or river, but may nest in woodland up to a mile from water. May nest in natural tree cavity in large hardwood tree, in abandoned woodpecker hole, or nest-box. Often nests in same area in successive years. May ""prospect"" for future nest sites at end of breeding season."
Aythya valisineria,"Wide variety of open woodland and open country with scattered trees, rarely in denser forest (AOU 1983), but nests in forest and takes prey from forest canopy in Puerto Rico (Recher and Recher 1966, Santana 1988). Elevated perches are important element of habitat. <br><br>Nests in trees to 37 m above ground, frequently high in tallest tree near edge of woods; also, in treeless country, in top of shrub, cactus, or on cliff. Often returns to same nesting area in successive years."
Baeolophus bicolor,"Nonbreeding: grasslands, field, marshes, sagebrush flats, and open cultivated areas; sometimes rat-infested garbage dumps. Nests on cliffs (typically) or in trees in arctic and subarctic, in tundra, mountain sides, forests with plenty of open ground. Sometimes nests on the ground or on man-made structures. Apparently nests more commonly along coasts and on marine islands. May compete for nest sites with raven, peregrine falcon, and gyrfalcon (latter two often use nests built by rough-legged hawk). May use same nest in successive years."
Bartramia longicauda,"BREEDING: varies from bottomland hardwoods and riparian areas (Stewart 1949, Henny et al. 1973, Bednarz and Dinsmore 1981, Kimmel and Fredrickson 1981, Woodrey 1986, Preston et al. 1989) to upland deciduous or mixed deciduous-conifer forest (Titus and Mosher 1981, Armstrong and Euler 1983, Morris and Lemon 1983, Crocoll and Parker 1989). Nesting areas are almost always found near some form of water, such as a swamp, marsh, river, or pond (Preston et al. 1989, Bosakowski et al. 1992), and the habitat is usually well forested (Portnoy and Dodge 1979, Kimmel and Fredrickson 1981, Titus and Mosher 1981, Morris and Lemon 1983, Ebbers 1989). Further, nesting habitat typically is mature forest with a well-developed high canopy and variable amounts of understory vegetation (Postupalsky 1980, Titus and Mosher 1981, Armstrong and Euler 1983, Morris and Lemon 1983, Titus 1984, Preston et al. 1989.). Sometimes occurs in coniferous stands in the West. In California, has been expanding range of occupied habitats to include various woodlands, including stands of eucalyptus trees amid urban sprawl (Ehrlich et al. 1992). <br><br>The nest is usually built in the main crotch of a large, living tree in mature forest, although in Florida, palmettos may be used. In eastern North America, nests generally are far from forest edges. At least 43 species of mainly deciduous trees have been chosen, so that the size and shape seem more important than the actual species (Bednarz 1979, Apfelbaum and Seelbach 1983, Titus and Mosher 1987, Palmer 1988, Ebbers 1989). The bulky structure of twigs, rather flat on top, is typically placed approximately halfway up the tree in the lower portion of the canopy (Morris et al. 1982, Titus and Mosher 1987). The typical height is between 11-15 m but can range from 1.5-33.5 m (Peck and James 1983, Ebbers 1989). The nest is lined with stems, leaves, lichen, and bark. Active nests are decorated with greenery and other materials. Hemlock and other conifer sprigs are often mentioned as nest greenery, as are deciduous sprigs once they have leafed out, and Bent (1937) mentioned such plants as flowering violets and nightshade. Other materials have included cornstalks, ears, and husks, dried tent caterpillar webs, tissue paper, twine, and nests of eastern wood-pewee, red-eyed vireo, and northern oriole (Palmer 1988). <br><br>In eastern North America, may use nest used previously by barred owl (STRIX VARIA) (and vice versa) (Palmer 1988). See Dijak et al. (1990) for information on nest-site characteristics affecting success and reuse of nests in Missouri. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: less restricted than that used for breeding; favors lowland areas near water, either standing or running, including river valleys, swamps, marshes, and perhaps canyon bottoms (Palmer 1988), and level, open country with scattered large trees (Bent 1937). In Florida, Bohall and Collopy (1984) found hawks most often in open areas such as pastures and fallow fields."
Bombycilla cedrorum,"BREEDING: Broadleaf and mixed forest, preferring denser situations, less frequently in open woodland. Generally perches under or in tree canopy, forages at openings, edges, and wet areas (Palmer 1988). Regularly nests near wet areas and forest openings, edges, and woodland roads. Typically nests in crotch of moderate- to large-sized tree or on branch next to trunk, about 7-12 m above ground, in bottom 1/3 of forest canopy. May modify nest of other bird or squirrel; usually does not use same nest in 2 successive years. Presence of fresh greenery typical of completed nest (Palmer 1988). NON-BREEDING: Migrates along ridges, river valleys, and shorelines. In winter, may perch and feed along heavily traveled highways. In Costa Rica, prefers open areas, forest edge, broken forest (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Bonasa umbellus,"Swamps, mangroves, marshes, and margins of ponds, rivers, lakes, and lagoons. Eggs are laid in platform nest in tree, thicket, or bush over water or sometimes in dry woodland or orchard; nests in both freshwater and brackish situations."
Botaurus lentiginosus,"Arctic tundra in wet meadows, grassy tussocks and scrub, in migration and winter in weedy and grassy areas, plowed fields and stubble (AOU 1983). Nests on hummocky tundra, often in wet areas. Nests on ground in depression, frequently concealed by surrounding vegetation (Harrison 1978); often on south side of cottongrass tussock or polygon ridge (Johnson and Herter 1989). See also Rodrigues (1994)."
Branta canadensis,"Nonbreeding: primarily sandy beaches, less frequently on mud flats and shores of lakes or rivers (AOU 1983) also on exposed reefs (Pratt et al. 1987). Sleeps/loafs on upper beach or on salt pond dike. Nests on dry tundra, in stony locations or areas with low vegetation, within a few hundred meters of wet tundra. Nests on the ground in a shallow depression lined with mosses, leaves, or other plant material."
Bubo virginianus,"Nonbreeding: mudflats, estuaries, marshes, flooded fields, sandy or gravelly beaches, and shores of lakes, ponds, and sloughs (AOU 1983, Smith and Connors 1993). In central California, movements from coastal habitats to inland habitats occurred in conjunction with winter storms (heavy rain) (Warnock et al. 1995). On the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, major diurnal roost sites were adjacent to intertidal feeding areas, provided a unobstructed view of predators, and were close to shallow waters used for bathing (Handel and Gill 1992). Nests in wet coastal tundra (AOU 1983), grass or sedge tundra with pools and bogs. Nests on the ground, usually in drier sites such as strangmoor ridges."
Bubulcus ibis,"Primarily seacoasts on tidal flats and beaches, less frequently in marshes and flooded fields (AOU 1983). On sandy or pebbly beaches, especially at river mouths; feeds on mudflats, loafs and sleeps on salinas and salt-pond dikes (Costa Rica, Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests on ground in barren or stony tundra and in well-vegetated moist tundra."
Bucephala albeola,"Nonbreeding: grassy marshes, mudflats, sandy beaches, flooded fields, and shores of ponds and lakes (AOU 1983). <br><br>Grassy or mossy tundra, often not far from water; wet tundra, with nest sites on tops of hummocks; wet tundra with some microrelief, such as strangmoor ridges or frost scars. Nests on the ground in a shallow cup, lined with grass and other vegetation."
Bucephala clangula,"Nonbreeding: mudflats, flooded fields, shallow ponds and pools, and marshes (AOU 1983). Nests in sedge tundra near water, often near wooded borders of the taiga (AOU 1983), on the ground in a shallow scrape, often on a slightly raised site (e.g., atop small sedge hummock or on low well-drained gravel ridge crossing sedge meadow). Tends to return to same nesting site in successive years."
Buteo jamaicensis,"NON-BREEDING: rocky seacoasts and jetties, rarely along shores of large inland bodies of water, usually in rocky areas (AOU 1983). BREEDING: Nests in mossy tundra, moorlands and heath, and coastal barren flats. Nests on ground in open, seldom far from coast."
Buteo lagopus,"Nonbreeding: mudflats, beaches, shores of lakes and ponds, shallow lagoons, artificial salt ponds, and flooded fields; various coastal habitats with flat or gently sloping muddy, sandy, or gravelly shores; less often inland at pond edges, rain pools, wet fields (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Breeds coastally on sedge-dwarf tundra, on hummocks surrounded by marsh. Nests on the ground in a shallow depression, lined with leaves, lichen, and other plant material. Strong tendency to nest in same area in successive years."
Buteo lineatus,"NON-BREEDING: wet meadows, mudflats, flooded fields and golf courses, and shores of ponds and pools. Also found in grassy marshes and salt meadows, shores of lakes and rivers. BREEDING: Wet or moist coastal tundra (AOU 1983), with low-centered polygons or unpatterned ground; usually on dry fringes of well-vegetated wetlands (Hayman et al. 1986); where continuous grass or sedge cover is present. Nests on the ground, often under cover of grass tuft. Nest is a cup-like structure of grasses and leaves. See also Rodrigues (1994)."
Buteo platypterus,"Nonbreeding: wet meadows, mudflats, flooded fields, shores of pools and lakes, narrow channels, edge of salt marsh, river sandbars, sometimes sandy beaches. Nests in mossy or wet grassy tundra, in lush vegetation near pond, occasionally in drier areas with sparse vegetation or scattered bushes. In boggy site, nest usually on or inside moss hummock or plant tuft. In dry site, nest often near a plant."
Butorides virescens,"Nonbreeding: mudflats, sandy beaches, shores of lakes and ponds, and wet meadows (AOU 1983). In northern Alaska, postbreeding habitat was mainly coastal mudflats and slough edges (Smith and Connors 1993). Breeds on grassy or dry shrubby tundra, usually near water. In northern Alaska, favored areas with well-drained ridges for nesting and adjacent wet tundra for feeding (see Johnson and Herter 1989). Often returns to nest in natal area or area of previous nesting (Gratto et al. 1985). The nest is a shallow depression, lined with grasses, moss, and leaves. See also Rodrigues (1994)."
Calcarius lapponicus,"<i>Breeding:</i> Dry slopes with numerous sedge tussocks, on grass tundra with mosses and willows, in moist or wet sedge-grass meadows, in well-drained sandy areas with scant vegetation, and on well-vegetated hummocky ground bordering marshy ponds (Johnsgard 1981, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Godfrey 1986, Johnson and Herter 1989, Lanctot 1995). Prefers raised and grassy terrain, although the nature of the tundra often involves proximity to moist or wet ground (Cramp and Simmons 1983). Overall, avoids marshy areas (Johnsgard 1981).<br /><br />During incubation breaks, females occur along stream banks with scant vegetation (Lanctot 1995). Females with broods occur primarily in moist and emergent vegetation along wetlands and stream beds (Lanctot 1995).<br /><br />Landforms at leks are dominated by non-patterned ground, with reticulate-patterned ground, polygons, strangmoor, and frost-boils less commonly used (Lanctot and Slater 1992). Vegetation at leks is dominated by moist, graminoid (<i>Carex aquatilis</i> and <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>) and wet, graminoid meadows (Lanctot and Slater 1992). A third of all leks occur at traditional sites along bends and junctions of rivers (Lanctot 1995).<br /><br /><i>Non-breeding: </i>Southern temperate zone on predominantly dry to moist open ground, short grass uplands (grass height &lt; 3 cm). Individuals have also been observed in open mudflats or muddy shores near lakes and channels, abandoned and newly planted rice fields, and on burnt stubble after cutting sugar cane (Myers and Myers 1979, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Paulson 1993, Lanctot et al. 2001). Also utilize dry riverine sandbars, rain pools in pastures, golf courses, and airfields (Cramp and Simmons 1983).<br /><br /><i>Migration</i>: Frequents short grass plains and dry uplands (Johnsgard 1981). Have been observed in man-altered habitats such as sod fields, airport runways, golf courses, cemeteries, burnt-over grasslands, cotton fields, recently ploughed fields, newly planted rice fields, flat, hard, sun-baked stubble, and barren recently inundated land (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Lanctot, unpubl. data). Edges of ponds are used for wading, drinking, and bathing, but not feeding (Cramp and Simmons 1983)."
Calidris alba,"Pelagic. Eggs are laid in burrows or crevices on islands; nests in large colonies (up to 10s of 1000s of pairs) on isolated islands, in smaller colonies on offshore islets and inaccessible mainland cliffs (up to 32 km inland) (Palmer 1962)."
Calidris alpina,"In the US, this species inhabited swampy forests, especially large bottomland river swamps of coastal plain and Mississippi Delta and cypress swamps of Florida. In Cuba, it occurred mainly in high country in pine forests, also pine-hardwood forest and hardwood forest; formerly also in lowland forest. It preferred to nest in dead trees or in dead sections of living trees, at a height of about 4.6 m (15 ft) to >21 m (70 ft); most averaged >9 m (30 ft) (Jackson 2020)."
Calidris canutus,"Breeding habitat includes moist thickets of woodland undergrowth (especially aspen-poplar), bogs, tall shrubbery along streams or near swamps, and deciduous second growth. Habitat is more specific in localized regions. For example, the species is limited to forested wetlands in Rhode Island (Miller 1999) and hemlock-dominated ravines in Ohio (Mitchell 1999). Habitat predictors in western Maryland included limited ground cover but high foliage density between 0.3 and 1 meter (Robbins et al. 1989). Habitat in Rhode Island also included limited ground cover (a negative correlation with deciduous foliage cover within 0.5 meter of the ground) and a thick shrub layer (a positive correlation with foliage cover between 2 and 4 meters; Mitchell 1999). In northeastern British Columbia this warbler is associated with wet, usually unstable slopes in deciduous or mixed forests with a well-developed shrub layer and considerable amounts of woody debris (Campbell et al. 2001). Nests are on or near the ground, among roots of fallen trees, in cavities in banks, or on ledges, sides of rocks, hummocks, stumps, or fallen logs, or on the ground under shrubbery (Harrison 1978). <br><br>In migration, this warbler uses various forest, woodland, scrub, and thicket habitats, mostly in humid areas. In winter, it occurs in forested areas of foothills and mountains."
Calidris canutus rufa,"Habitat includes semi-open areas in moist woodlands, bogs with scattered trees, willow and alder thickets, and areas with similar vegatation structure. Winter habitats include semi-open or lightly wooded areas, such as the canopy, openings, and edges of forests, second growth, coffee plantations, brushy fields, and yards (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests are on the ground at the bases of shrubs (e.g., willows in the Sierra Nevada) or saplings or under cover of ground vegetation; nests may be above ground in thick vegetation in coastal California and Oregon. Individuals often return to the nesting areas used the previous year (Stewart et al. 1978)."
Calidris fuscicollis,"Thickets, brushy areas, fields, shrubbery, forest edge, clearings, around human habitation, and, in arid regions, in scrub, riparian thickets, woodland, and brush; typically avoids dense forest (but penetrates native forest in Hawaii). <br><br>Nests in dense shrubs, small deciduous or coniferous tree, thicket, vine, briar tangle, mesquite, generally 3 m or less above ground. Female builds a new nest in a different location on the territory for each nesting attempt (Filliater et al. 1994)."
Calidris himantopus,"Forested and open situations, more commonly in the latter, from lowlands to mountains (AOU 1983). May roost in large flocks at night in trees; roosts often near or over water. In Pennsylvania, selected large conifers for mid-winter roost (Wright et al. 1986). <br><br>Eggs are laid in caves (especially in West); on cliffs; in hollow logs, trees, or stumps (tree-cavity nesting formerly more common); on ground in dense shrubbery (especially in eastern U.S.); sometimes in/under abandoned building in woods (Jackson 1983, Palmer 1988); sometimes in abandoned hawk nest (Hilty and Brown 1986). In Pennsylvania/Maryland, nested in areas that were roadless, forested, and undeveloped (Coleman and Fraser 1989)."
Calidris maritima,"In New England and New York, inhabits montane forests, primarily areas dominated by stunted balsam fir and red spruce at elevations above 3000 ft (Rimmer et al. 1993). Habitats in Canada include mountaintop and dense coastal coniferous forests as well as mixed second-growth regenerating stands (Rimmer 1996). In southern Quebec, occurs mainly in second growth stands characterized by relatively young conifers of small size (balsam fir, white spruce) intermixed with a variety of deciduous species typical of second-growth regeneration (PRUNUS sp., BEUnrankable LA sp., AMELANCHIER sp., ACER SPICAUnrankable M, POPULUS sp.) following forest fires or clear cutting; trees seldom exceed 10 m in height (Ouellet 1993). Nests generally are situated close to the trunk in the upper half of a small-to-medium-sized fir or spruce, typically in conifer thickets, often on steep slopes (Rimmer 1996). In migration and winter also in deciduous forest, forest borders, open woodland, second growth, and scrub. Winter habitat may be restricted to primary tropical forest (Rimmer et al. 1993). Occurred at fairly high densities in moist, broad-leafed montane forest in the Dominican Republic (Rimmer 1996)."
Calidris mauri,"Nesting habitat includes swampy forest, especially in more open areas with shrubby understory, as well as second growth, willow or alder shrubbery near water; large tracts of forest are most suitable. Nests usually are on or near the ground, at the base of a shrub, in a clump of herbaceous vegetation, or in a shrub or low tree (Terres 1980). In migration and winter this species occurs also in lowland forest, woodland, and scrub."
Calidris melanotos,"Open humid coniferous and mixed forest and forest edge, dry sandy and sparse jackpine, less frequently in deciduous forest and thickets; in migration and winter also chaparral, riparian woodland, arid pine-oak, desert scrub. Negatively impacted by forest fragmentation in southern Wyoming (Keller and Anderson 1992). Associated with large (>24 ha) aspen groves in Saskatchewan (Johns 1993). Nests usually on ground under conifer with low branches or hidden by low plants, or in low conifer or other tree or bush within 3 m of ground."
Calidris minutilla,"Coniferous forest (mainly spruce), tall shrubby areas in taiga, willow and alder thickets near water or above tree line (Ouellet 1993); in migration and winter also in deciduous forest, forest borders, open woodland, second growth, and scrub. Nests from ground level to about 6 m up, in willow, alder, or spruce (Terres 1980)."
Calidris pusilla,"Breeding habitat includes dense vegetation in coniferous  forests, mixed hardwood-conifer forests (e.g., across Canada and northern New England, predominantly hardwood forests (e.g., in Northeast), riparian woodland and thickets of willow or alder (e.g., California and other western states at south end of range), aspen forests (e.g. southwest part of range),  and sometimes coastal scrub (California) (Mack and Yong 2000). Depending on the location, this species may be associated with young, mature, or old growth (see Mack and Wong 2000). Range-wide, nesting occurs at elevations from sea level to 2,600 meters or higher. Nests usually are in small trees, close to the trunk, often 2 meters or less above ground; often in conifers, sometimes deciduous trees or shrubs (e.g., willow).<br><br>During migration, this species uses a wide range of wooded and shrubby habitats, generally with thick undergrowth.<br><br>During the boreal winter, Swainson's thrushes inhabit a wide range of conditions that may vary with region, including primary forest, mature selva forest, tropical semideciduous forest, humid to semihumid evergreen and semideciduous forest (including  pine-oak, coniferous, tropical deciduous, and cloud forest), secondary growth, and forest-pasture edges, and human-made openings with ornamental shrubs (see Mack and Yong 2000)."
Calidris subruficollis,"BREEDING: Open fields and meadows with grass interspersed with weeds or shrubby vegetation, especially in damp or low-lying areas, adjacent to salt marsh in some areas. Uses unmowed hayfields (abandoned if cut). Found in a variety of habitats that contain tall, dense grass and herbaceous vegetation (Smith 1968, 1992). Hyde (1939) describes a variety of preferred habitats: upland weedy hayfields or pastures without shrubs, wet meadows, drier areas of saltmarshes, grassy fields, and sedgy hillsides with recently planted pine seedlings (PINUS spp.). Graber (1968) found that their habitat was usually quite dense from 30-61 cm off the ground and reported them to be ""adapted"" to unmowed hayfields. In New York, Peterson (1983) found them in large, ungrazed fields, often on hilltops, with a variety of moisture regimes and no woody invasion. They are not typically associated with grazed areas (Peterson 1983, Zimmerman 1988), although they can survive quite well in pastures that are only lightly (Skinner 1975) or moderately (Smith and Smith 1990) grazed. <br /><br />Wiens (1969), in his three year study, found four territories in the first and third years and none in the second year. He found that territories had a low percent cover of forbs, dense vegetation, a high effective vegetation height, little bare ground or low vegetation, and no trees, posts, or fence lines. <br /><br />In eastern part of range, are reported in ""...moist upland meadows not under the plow, grown up to clumps of ferns, tall meadow rue (THALICTRUM spp.), and scattered shrubbery"" in Vermont (Kibbe and Laughlin 1985); ""...in small swales, meadows or other moist grassy lands...in fields of heavy timothy or clover"" in Massachusetts (Forbush 1929); and ""...in grassy fields and meadows with scattered bushes and herbaceous plants, both in wet and dry situations"" in New York (Bull 1974). In addition to the above types of habitats, occurrences have been reported in wet meadows vegetated by sedges (CAREX spp.), rushes (SCIRPUS spp.) and grasses, in fields of seedling pines, and in drier upland portions of saltmarshes in the Northeast (Craig 1979). <br /><br />Along the Atlantic Coast, the birds probably nested on the edges of saltmarshes before the arrival of Europeans (Hyde 1939, Craig 1979). In West Virginia, Hall (1983) reports that Henslow's sparrows ""...prefer fields with growths of orchard grass [DACTYLIS GLOMERATA] or a rank weedy growth."" Birds in Maryland have occurred chiefly in broomsedge (CAREX SCOPARIA) fields and weedy sedge meadows, and occasionally in hayfields (Stewart and Robbins 1958). Near Louisville, Kentucky, ""...exclusively in or near fields largely or wholly composed of the orchard grass much raised locally as a crop, and has preferred the crop fields to patches of untended grass"" (Mengel 1965). In Kentucky, Mengel (1965) noted that the sparrow often occurred in association with sedge wrens (CISTOTHORUS PLATENSIS) and in dry, upland sites that were in marked contrast to the marshy, meadow habitats considered typical habitat by Hyde (1939). <br /><br />In the Midwest and Great Plains regions, formerly bred in tallgrass prairie interspersed with forbs and shrubs. Where tallgrass prairie persists, J. Zimmerman (pers. comm.) reports that they still use it for nesting habitat in Kansas and Missouri. At present, typical breeding habitat includes neglected grassy fields, pastures and meadows with scattered shrubby vegetation, or hayfields with dense cover, usually in damp or low-lying areas (Whitney et al. 1978, Johnsgard 1979, AOU 1983). Bajema et al. (2001) document extensive use of grasslands on reclaimed coal mines in southwestern Indiana, and estimated a density of 0.16 males per hectare, suggesting an overall population of 'a few thousand' in the mine grasslands of southwestern Indiana. <br /><br />In a brome grass/alfalfa/red clover hayfield in southwestern Michigan, they bred in areas with an intermediate moisture range, a continuous cover of grasses and sedges about 0.8 m high, occasional shrubs, mostly less than 0.9 m high, and accumulated litter (no data on litter depth or percent coverage) (Robins 1971). <br /><br />Fall and Eliason (1982) located a nest in Hennepin County, Minnesota, at the top of a knoll in an old field. Timothy comprised about 80% of the biomass of the 0.5 m-high vegetation. Except for a few shrubs approximately 0.5 m-high, there was no woody vegetation within 100 m, the vegetation covered about 75% of the soil surface, and there was a complete litter layer up to five cm deep. <br /><br />Wiens (1969) compared the vegetation structure at nests with the vegetation in unoccupied areas in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Occupied areas had significantly lower coverage and density of forbs, especially broad-leaved types, and the forb height was significantly greater (occupied average height = 27 cm). In occupied areas, the vertical vegetation density was higher and the litter was deeper and covered a higher percentage of the soil surface (average depth = 4.3 cm, 93% coverage). <br /><br />Nest is well-hidden in grass, either at base of grass tuft (usually) or to 40 cm up in stems of growing herbage. <br /><br />NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter also occurs in grassy areas adjacent to pine woods or second-growth woods. No detailed descriptions or studies of the habitat requirements of the winter range are available."
Calonectris diomedea,"Preferred habitat includes forest, woodlands, forested floodplains and swamps. Scrub and parks are also used in winter and during migration. Most often found in coniferous and mixed forests. A study by Franzreb (1985) describes the habitat in Arizona as mixed-coniferous forest, dominated by Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and southwestern white pine. Within the habitat, birds selected the largest (tallest) trees most often for foraging. Hejl (pers. comm.) reported finding larger numbers in western redcedar stands than in the Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stands in 1992 field work. <br><br>In the eastern U.S. south of the northern conifer zone, populations occur regularly in forested floodplains, and sometimes swamps. Hamas (pers. comm.), based on his experience, suggested that floodplain forests may be important habitat in Michigan. Davis (1978) studied populations in Michigan in two different forest types. One was an old white cedar, balsam fir, and black spruce swamp, with components of sugar maple, red maple, white pine, basswood and paper birch. The other was more topographically varied and drier; tree species included red maple, American beech, with less common white oak, eastern hemlock, large-toothed aspen, butternut hickory, and American elm. In the wetter areas of this site, dead American elms were common, and in the wettest areas, white cedar and eastern hemlock occurred. Davis (1978) found that all nests were in dead trees, and all nest trees were near water. Two were in swamps, while all others were within 60 m of flowing streams. <br><br>A component of dead trees is essential for nesting, so brown creepers tend to be associated with older forests. Hejl and Woods (1991) found them in old growth forests (200+ yr), but never in rotation-aged (80 to 120 yr) Douglas- fir/ponderosa pine stands in western Montana and adjacent Idaho. The birds have also been known to move into areas where many trees have died due to flooding or disease (Bent 1948). <br><br>Temporary positive impacts have been created by Dutch elm and other forest diseases, and by artificial floodings in forested areas. Both diseases and floodings leave standing dead wood and create large numbers of good nesting sites. However, the suitability of the habitat is, of course, only temporary in these situations. Creepers have been reported to become abundant in such situations (Bent 1948, Davis 1978, Nicholson pers. comm.), suggesting a certain degree of opportunism. Forest, woodland, swamps; also scrub and parks in winter and migration. Negatively impacted by forest fragmentation in southern Wyoming (Keller and Anderson 1992). <br><br>Nests usually behind loose slab of bark still attached to living or dead tree, average of 1.5-5 m above ground (Harrison 1979). Also occasionally in knot holes when loose bark is not available (Bent 1948). One observer (Bent 1948) noted that nests were often under the only remaining piece of bark on a dead tree. Davis (1978) found that tree canopy was partially open at each nest site in a Michigan study."
Campephilus principalis,"Cosmopolitan; inhabits rural and urban environments having both an abundance of flying arthropods and suitable roosting/nesting sites. Nests principally in chimneys, but also on the interior walls of a variety of other anthropogenic structures including silos, barns, outhouses, uninhabited houses, boathouses, wells, and cisterns (Bent 1940). Natural nest sites include the interior of hollow tree trunks and branches, Pileated Woodpecker cavities and rock shelters (Bent 1940, Fisher 1958, Hofslund 1958). Trees in which nests have been found include American Beech (FAUnrankable S GRANDIFOLIA), Yellow Birch (BEUnrankable LA LUTEA), Silver Maple (ACER SACCHARINUM), Sycamore (PLATANUS OCCIDENTALIS), Bald Cypress (TAXODIUM DISTICHUM), and Water Tupelo (NYSSA AQUATICA; Blodgett and Zammuto 1979, Fischer 1958, Hofslund 1958, Mumford and Keller 1984, Stevenson and Anderson 1994). Due to the prevalence of nesting structures in areas populated by humans, often occurs at higher densities in anthropogenic environments than natural ones (i.e., forests; Beissinger and Osborne 1982). Migrating flocks roost overnight principally in chimneys, but also in hollow trees or, rarely, even exposed on tree trunks (Bent 1940, Spendelow 1985)."
Cardellina canadensis,"BREEDING: Sandy upper beaches, especially where scattered grass tufts are present, and sparsely vegetated shores and islands of shallow lakes, ponds, rivers, and impoundments. Nests may also be built on sandy open flats among shells or cobble behind foredunes (e.g., in Michigan and New Jersey) (Master, pers. comm.). <br><br>ATLANTIC COAST: breeds mainly on gently sloping foredunes and blow-out areas behind primary dunes of sandy coastal beaches, and on suitable dredge oil deposits (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1988). In Maine, piping plovers nest only on sandy beaches notably lacking in small or large stones (Vickery, pers. comm.). <br><br>GREAT LAKES: Breeds on sand and gravel shorelines, and behind foredune among cobble and sparse vegetation on islands (Powell and Cuthbert 1992). Lambert and Ratcliff (1979) found that the average beach used for nest habitat in Michigan was 37 meters wide and that the nests were located an average of 13 meters from the water's edge (14 meters from the first dune and 109 meters from the nearest tree line). They also found a preference for nesting near other water bodies (beach pools, lagoons, or cuts) that may provide additional food sources. In Minnesota Point (Duluth, Minnesota), the average ground cover was less than 5 percent, and plants were an average of 13 centimeters tall (Niemi and Davis 1979). Niemi and Davis (1979) found that less than 8 percent of the available beach habitat was suitable for piping plover nesting. At Pine and Curry Islands (Lake of the Woods, Minnesota), nest on a sandy island where vegetation rarely exceeds 1 meter in height (Cuthbert and Wiens 1982). Vegetation included <i>Salix interior, Artemisia campestris, Lathyrus japonicus, Xanthium</i> spp., <i>Populus balsamifera, Polygonum</i> spp., <i>Oenothera</i> spp., grasses, and sedges. <br><br>GREAT PLAINS: 60 percent of breeding birds use shorelines around small alkaline lakes, 18 percent use large reservoir beaches, 20 percent use river islands and adjacent sand pits, 2 percent use beaches on large lakes, and 0.4 percent use industrial pond shorelines (Haig and Plissner 1993). Suitable breeding habitats are wide beaches (> 20 meters) with highly clumped vegetation, having less than 5 percent overall vegetation cover and/or with extensive gravel (USFWS 1988). <br><br>Vegetation cover on nesting islands is generally less than 25 percent (USFWS 1988). Woody species encroachment is a problem at many alluvial island sites due to reduced flows (Hay and Lingle 1981; Lingle, pers. comm.). This is also a problem on saline wetland shorelines due to drawdown and irrigation pumping (Soine, pers. comm.). <br><br>NONBREEDING: Usually on ocean beaches or on sand or algal flats in protected bays (Haig 1992). Most abundant on expansive sandflats, sandy mudflats, and sandy beach in close proximity; usually in areas with high habitat heterogeneity. At Laguna Madre, Texas, Drake et al. (2001) found this species to be most abundant on algal flats in fall and spring, but used exposed sand flats more often in winter. See Nicholls and Baldasarre (1990) for further information on winter habitat associations in the southeastern U.S."
Cardellina pusilla,"Nonbreeding: mudflats, shallow marshes, beaches, flooded fields, salinas, shores of river mouths, and shores of lakes and ponds (AOU 1983). Use of freshwater habitats occurs mostly during migration. <br><br>Nests on grassy or mossy tundra, river gravel bars, coastal flats and dunes, beaches, stony ridges, and other rocky well-drained, and/or barren habitats (Johnson and Herter 1989). The nest may be a shallow depression scraped out by the bird; may also nest in moss or lichens."
Cardinalis cardinalis,"Habitat includes various open areas such as fields, meadows, lawns, pastures, mudflats, and shores of lakes, ponds, rivers, and seacoasts (AOU 1983). Nests are on the ground ground in open dry or gravelly situations, sometimes in similar situations on roofs, driveways, etc."
Cathartes aura,"Coastal sandy and shell beaches, barrier and spoil islands, borders of salt ponds, tidal mudflats, inlets, bays, estuaries, and sometimes sandbars and mudbanks of rivers near the coast (Johnsgard 1981, Raffaele 1989, Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests principally on sand or bare soil near salt or brackish water (Bent 1929, Sprandel 1996, Tomkins 1944). Nests are either out in the open, or near sparse vegetation or some object (Tomkins 1944). <br><br>Nests in Texas were 50-1100 meters from water (Bergstrom 1988). In the Florida Keys, three nests were under small mangroves, and near the Indian River, Florida, nests were among open stands of glasswort (SALICORNIA) or pickerelweed (PONTEDARIA; Bent 1929). In Virginia, nests on the upper portions of sandy beaches on barrier islands, usually within 30 meters of dune vegetation but not in dense vegetation; sometimes on overwash flats behind the dunes (Byrd and Johnston 1991). In Texas, 98 percent of nests were within 0.5 meter of a plant, and 12 percent were within 2-30 centimeters (mean = 12 centimeters) of objects including cow manure, a pipe, and a stone (Bergstrom 1988). The vegetation near most nests in Texas was in the direction of the prevailing winds, presumably providing a windbreak for the nest (Bergstrom 1988). In South Carolina, nests have been found amid sparse cordgrass (SPARTINA PATENS; Tomkins 1944). Toland (1999) attributed the difficulty in locating incubating plovers in Indian River County, Florida to the camouflaging effect of surrounding beach croton (CROTON PUNCTAUnrankable S). <br><br>Nests are sometimes located on anthropogenic surfaces. Most nests (76 percent) at Laguna Atascosa, Texas were on or at the edge of an old abandoned road surfaced with gravel or shells; at Matagorda Island, Texas, 45 percent of nests were on old concrete or asphalt pavement (Bergstrom 1988). Rooftops are rarely used for nesting (Fisk 1978). Often nests in association with other birds including least tern (STERNA ANTILLARUM), common nighthawk (CHORDEILES MINOR), snowy plover (CHARADRIUS ALEXANDRINUS), piping plover (CHARADRIUS MELODUS), American avocet (RECURVIROSTRA AMERICANA), black-necked stilt (HIMANTOPUS MEXICANUS), and American oystercatcher (HAEMATOPUS PALLIAUnrankable S; Bent 1929, Bergstrom 1988)."
Catharus bicknelli,"BREEDING: marshes, along sloughs, rivers, lakeshores, and impoundments, or in wet meadows, typically in sites with mixture of emergent vegetation and open water. Cattails, bulrushes, burreed, and/or phragmites commonly are present in nesting areas (Bent 1921, Cuthbert 1954, Goodwin 1960, Bailey 1977, Firstencel 1987, Novak 1990). Nested in greatest numbers where emergent vegetation and open water are in an approximately 50:50 ratio (Weller and Spatcher 1965). In Wisconsin, Tilghman (1979) found nests in areas where emergent marsh coverage was 51-75%. In British Columbia, nests occurred in areas with 33% open water, 42% matted vegetation, and 25% standing vegetation (Chapman-Mosher 1987). <br><br>Nests may be placed in a variety of vegetative situations, from dense stands of emergent vegetation to open water (Bergman et al. 1970, Novak 1990), but moderate or sparse vegetation appears to be preferred (Cuthbert 1954, Weller and Spatcher 1965, Dunn 1979). Nests are typically located in shallow water, close to open water or openings in stands of emergent vegetation. The range of water depths reported varies from a ""few inches"" (Bent 1921) to 1-2 m (Dunn 1979). Bailey (1977) found that nests were never more than 1-2 m from open water. Dunn (1979) and Cuthbert (1954) reported the average distance to open water as 4 m and 4.6-6.1 m, respectively. One site in New York where 9 nests averaged 25.3 m from open water (Novak 1990) appears to be the exception, although Firstencel (1987) also reported nests located ""deep within the cattails"". <br><br>Nests on heap of floating vegetation, on old muskrat house, old grebe or coot nest, or on floating wood (Cuthbert 1954, Bergman et al. 1970, Bailey 1977, Dunn 1979, Novak 1990). Floating mats of muck or algae, mud flats, and mud mounds and islands also have been used as nest substrates (Cuthbert 1954, Bailey 1977, Dunn 1979, Connell and Norman 1989, Novak 1990). The nest consists of a small gathering of aquatic vegetation with a simple, cup-like bowl (Weller and Spatcher 1965, Bailey 1977). Although the first egg may be laid before the nest takes shape, vegetation gathered at the nest site is added throughout the incubation period (Baggerman et al. 1956, Goodwin 1960, Bailey 1977). Will nest on artificial nesting platforms (Muller et al. 1992). The height of eggs above water has often been measured. Although the height may vary based upon substrate chosen for nesting, the eggs are rarely located more than a few centimeters above the water level. The range reported in the literature varies from an average of 2.3 cm for 23 nests on dead floating vegetation in Iowa (Bergman et al. 1970), to 20.0 cm for two nests located on mud islands in New York (Firstencel 1987). The latter is clearly the exception as 8.6 cm for seven nests on old muskrat houses is the next highest figure reported (Weller and Spatcher 1965). <br><br>Exposed perches, such as channel marker posts, floating logs, fallen trees, and old dock or fence posts are used as stations for feeding recently fledged young, resting, and copulation (Cuthbert 1954, Novak 1990). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: pelagic waters as well as seacoasts, bays, estuaries, lagoons, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers (Eisenmann 1951, Zaret and Paine 1973, van Halewijn 1973, Spaans 1978, AOU 1983, Williams 1983); prefers sheltered offshore waters and bays, comes to shore chiefly during migrations (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Catharus fuscescens,"Breeding habitat includes various open situations with scattered bushes and trees: shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie with a shrub component and sparse litter; parkland; sandhills; barrens; oldfields; cultivated fields; shrub thickets; shrubsteppe (native and altered); woodland edges; shelterbelts; orchards, parks; riparian areas; brushy pastures; overgrazed pastures; and savanna, (Rand 1948, Baepler 1968, Newman 1970, Rising 1974, Stewart 1975, Salt and Salt 1976, Wiens and Rotenberry 1981, Faanes 1983, Dinsmore et al. 1984, Kahl et al. 1985, Walley 1985, Sample 1989, Wershler et al. 1991, Bock and Bock 1992, Cable et al. 1992, Kaspari and Joern 1993, Zimmerman 1993, Bock et al. 1995, Faanes and Lingle 1995, Best et al. 1997, Prescott 1997, AOU 1998, Martin and Parrish 2000). <br><br>In Nevada, this species preferred areas of crested wheatgrass that were invaded by sagebrush over areas dominated solely by either sagebrush or wheatgrass; abundance was negatively correlated with sagebrush density (McAdoo et al. 1989). In Arizona, inhabited areas characterized by mean habitat values of 38 percent bare ground, 54 percent grass cover, 7 percent forb cover, less than 2 percent canopy cover, 13 centimeter grass height, and 0.068 shrubs per square meter; individuals usually were flushed near mesquite (Bock and Webb 1984). <br><br>Nests are either on the ground or close to the ground (most often within 4 meters) in woody vegetation (Ely 1957, Baepler 1968, McNair 1985). Ground nests may be located in areas of sparse ground cover such as those areas associated with burning, moderate to heavy grazing, or poor or eroded soils (Fitch 1958, Graber and Graber 1963, Baepler 1968, Kahl et al. 1985, Walley 1985, Zimmerman 1993, Prescott 1997), or in idle fields, lawns, and cemeteries (Baepler 1968, Salt and Salt 1976, Walley 1985). Ground nests often are placed at the base of a plant (Ely 1957, Baepler 1968, Rising 1974). In Montana, nests always were located under sagebrush (Cameron 1908). Above-ground nests may be located in various species of shrubs, saplings, and small trees (Baepler 1968, Newman 1970, McNair 1985). This species sometimes uses old nests of other birds (e.g., northern mockingbird, thrasher).<br><br>Nonbreeding habitats include agricultural areas, suburban gardens, oak woodlands, chaparral, and mesquite/acacia grassland (Rising 1996)."
Catharus guttatus,"Habitats include mountains and plains in open and semi-open areas: open coniferous forests, savanna, grasslands, fields, vicinity of cities and towns. Nesting occurs on the ground on a bare site in an open area. In some areas, this species also nests on flat gravel roofs of buildings, perhaps related to prey availability at artificial lights. It prefers areas with sandy soil in the southern United States."
Catharus minimus,"NON-BREEDING: along seacoasts, bays and harbors, estuaries, mudflats, marshes, rivers, lakes, ponds, and flooded fields (AOU 1983).

Found in extensive tracts of dry upland woods where it uses the midstory canopy and the overstory canopy for most activities (Legrand and Hamel 1980). High-ground forest, open woodland, thickets, willow (SALIX spp.), alder (ALNUS spp.), aspen (POPULUS spp.), vines (del Hoyo et al. 1997). In northern plains also utilizes prairie shrub thickets and shelterbelts at lower elevations (Dobkin 1994). In Colorado, most observations in urban forests characterized by introduced tree species. Next most common sightings occur in riparian vegetation dominated by cottonwoods (POPULUS spp.) and boxelders (BISON-M 1997). <br><br>Nests in groves of trees, forest edges, moist thickets, overgrown pastures; in deciduous or evergreen tree or shrub. Is a low or ground nesting species (Peterjohn et al. 1995). Nest an open cup, average 1.8 meters above ground, but at times almost on the ground and concealed by tall herbage (Bent 1940, Harrison 1978, Spencer 1943). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: During migration occurs from tropical evergreen forest to arid subtropical scrub. In New Mexico occurs where stream conditions provide sufficient permanent moisture for the emergent plants or for a narrow band of deciduous trees and shrubs; at low elevation characterized by cottonwood and sycamore (PLATANUS spp.), at mid-elevations by white alder (ALNUS RHOMBIFOLIA) and bigleaf maple (ACER MACROPHYLLUS), and at high elevations by willow (DeGraaf et al. 1991). In Costa Rica, in second growth, scrubby areas, semi-open, forest edge (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Scrub (arid or humid) as well as forest, although most frequently in lowland humid regions (AOU 1998). Generally found from lowlands up to 2000 meters (del Hoyo et al. 1997). Chipley (1976) observed species in remnant subtropical oak woodland at 1800 meters in Colombia."
Charadrius wilsonia,"Open forest, both deciduous and coniferous, open woodland, open situations with scattered trees and snags, riparian woodland, pine-oak association, parks (AOU 1983). Nests in dead tree trunk, or stump, or dead top of live tree; sometimes nests in wooden pole, building or earth bank. Digs a nest hole cavity or reuses old one. Holes usually 2.5-7.5 m above ground (Harrison 1978)."
Chlidonias niger,"Inhabits a wide variety of vegetation types, particularly early successional stages. Occurs in croplands, grasslands, pastures, fallow fields, grass-brush rangelands, open pinelands, open mixed pine-hardwood forests, and habitat mosaics (Brennan 1999). In the Midwest and Northeast, associated principally with heterogeneous, patchy landscapes comprised of moderate amounts of row crops and grasslands and abundant woody edge (Burger and Linduska 1967, Roseberry and Sudkamp 1998). Open canopy (&lt;50%) pinelands and mixed pine-hardwood forests that have diverse groundcover vegetation, provide ideal habitat in the south (Brennan 1999, DeVos and Mueller 1993). In Texas rangelands, prefers areas containing the most bare ground, least grass cover, and most tall forbs (Hammerquist-Wilson and Crawford 1981). In the Oklahoma panhandle, prefers wooded riparian habitats (Schemnitz 1964). Selects more open, taller vegetation types than Scaled Quail (CALLIPEPLA SQUAMATA) in areas of sympatry in Texas (Reid et al. 1979). Nests on the ground, in a scrape lined with grasses and/or other dead vegetation, typically within standing herbaceous vegetation within 15-20 m of openings such as roads or fields. Grasses are typically woven over the top of the nest to conceal it (Brennan 1999)."
Chondestes grammacus,"In wild state along rocky seacoasts or inland in gorges, river valleys, caves, and desert oases. Feral birds occasionally in natural habitats, more abundantly near human settlement, especially in cities and around farms. Nests in cliff ledges, caves, building ledges, bridge structures, monuments, abandoned houses and barns, and in palm trees (e.g., West Indies)."
Chordeiles minor,"Once inhabited open country with trees and bushes, sandy reefs, open sandy areas in forest and savannah, but over much of its range now primarily a bird of cultivated land, villages and towns (Goodwin 1983). In general, habitat structure rather than species composition appears to be a the best predictor of suitable habitat (Landers and Buckner 1979). Found primarily in open areas with plants that produce small seeds such as abandoned agricultural fields, young pine plantations or citrus groves and other early successional habitats. These habitats tend satisfy their food and nesting requirements because forbs and grasses that produce small seeds, a major food of Ground-Doves, are generally abundant there (Landers and Buckner 1979). <br><br>Landers and Buckner (1979) found that sites with Ground-Doves were much more open than those without doves, and that sites with doves had smaller diameter trees than those without. Additionally, Ground-Doves may require a bare ground component for feeding and cover consisting of trees and shrubs in the desert or cropland and other habitat. Early seral stages also provide good nesting cover. Sandy soils with low natural fertility may be closely associated with this species (Hopkins 1958) because they tend to retard the rate of succession and make suitable Ground-Dove habitat available for longer periods of time (Jones and Mirarchi 1990). <br><br>Especially in the arid southwestern U.S., Ground-Doves are often associated with riparian areas. In New Mexico occurs up to 1524 m (5,000 ft.) in shrubby riparian habitat often at the edges of riparian woodlands and in desert shrub dominated by mesquite or OPUNTIA SPP. In California, found in desert scrub and near edges of desert riparian habitats, as well as in alkali desert scrub, desert wash, orchard-vineyard, and eucalyptus habitats, usually below 305 m (1000 ft.) (Small 1994). In coastal California, Ground-Doves prefer river valleys with similar growth (Garrett and Dunn 1981). In the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, occurs in desert scrub, open to dense vegetation of shrubs, low trees and succulents dominated by paloverde (CERCIDIUM MICROPHYLLUM), prickly pear (OPUNTIA SPP.), and giant saguaro (CEREUS GIGANTEUS). In the Chihuahuan Desert found in open stands of creosote bush and large succulents (FEROCACUnrankable S PRINGLEI, ECHINOCACUnrankable S PLATYACONTHUS, NMDGF 1994). <br><br>In the lower Colorado River region prefers agricultural edges, orchards and sparse riparian vegetation. Nests here can be found in almost any tree species with willows and mesquites near a water source preferred. Occurs in suburban habitats at Yuma, where it replaces the Inca Dove (COLUMBINA INCA) which is the small suburban dove elsewhere in the valley and throughout most of central and southern Arizona (Rosenberg et al.1991). In Texas, however, Ground-Dove habitat is quite different. Inca Dove typically occupies the cultivated areas, leaving brushy rangeland to the this species (Oberholser 1974), but Ground-Doves are also found in orchards, brushy rangeland, and open woodlands. Oberholser (1974) describes this species reaching its maximum density in the state of Texas on the one-million-acre King Ranch located in Kleberg and Kenedy counties where the primary habitat type was grassy mesquite-live oak-cactus savanna. Also found in scrubby juniper-oak associations in the Trans-Pecos and on the Edwards Plateau. <br><br>In Florida, Ground-Doves can be found in almost any habitat type from sea coast to pine flatwoods, except in wetlands. In Florida and South Texas birds also commonly nest in citrus groves (Mitchell et al. 1996) and sometimes in wax myrtle (MYRICA CERIFERA) on the coastal plain. In Georgia, nests in 5-year-old slash pine (PINUS ELLIOTTII) plantations (Landers and Buckner 1976). Hopkins (1957) reports that plum trees and some species of PRUNUS are usually present in Ground-Dove habitat in this state as well. Of sixty-nine sites surveyed by Jones and Mirarchi (1990) in Alabama, habitat types included old field (31), young pine plantation (23), forest (7), agricultural field (4), coastal dune (3) and homesite (1). Among coastal sites they recorded Common Ground-Doves in all vegetative zones from the foredunes through the hinddunes. Also observed in freshly plowed or recently harvested agricultural fields, and in hardwood and pine forest types. <br><br>Populations in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands occur primarily in coastal habitat from mangroves, palm groves and residential areas, cane field and arid scrublands. Most common in arid regions and is only absent from heavily wooded areas (Raffaele 1983). Throughout the remainder of its range, found in arid lowland scrub, low seasonally wet grassland, arid montane scrub, second growth scrub (0-1400m) in the tropical and subtropical zones."
Chroicocephalus philadelphia,"BRIEF SUMMARY: Olive-sided flycatchers breed in various forest and woodland habitats: taiga, subalpine coniferous forest, mixed coniferous-deciduous forest, burned-over forest, spruce or tamarack bogs and other forested wetlands, and along the forested edges of lakes, ponds, and streams Most nesting sites contain dead standing trees, which are used as singing and feeding perches. Nests are placed most often in conifers, on horizontal limbs 2-15 meters from the ground. During the northern winter, this species occurs in a variety of forest, woodland, and open situations with scattered trees, especially where tall dead snags are present.<br/><br/>BREEDING: in forest and woodland, especially in burned-over areas with standing dead trees, in taiga, subalpine coniferous forest and mixed coniferous-deciduous forest (AOU 1983). In Ontario, they nest in spruce or tamarack bogs, along the forested edges of beaver (<i>Castor canadensis</i>) ponds and rivers, and in burned-over forests (Cheskey 1987). In New York, however, where forest fires have been suppressed for much of this century, they favor small bog ponds and quaking bogs, swampy edges of lakes, marshy streams, backwaters of rivers, and beaver meadows. Most nesting sites contain dead standing trees, which are used as singing and feeding perches, and are bordered by forest (Peterson 1988). Birds also use small mountaintop ponds. Forests surrounding these sites are usually coniferous or mixed with deciduous trees. Black spruce (<i>Picea mariana</i>) is frequently mentioned as occurring at northern sites, and red spruce (<i>P. rubens</i>) at sites farther south, along with balsam fir, tamarack, and eastern hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i>) (Peterson 1988). <br/><br/>Forbush (1927) and Griscom and Snyder (1955) mentioned that in southern New England, pitch pine (<i>Pinus rigida</i>) habitats, including pine barrens, are preferred for nesting. Nesting occurs in swamps and open woods or small clearings where fire, flooding or timber harvesting have left standing dead trees (Forbush 1927). High elevation spruce-fir forests are used in the mountains of Virginia and North Carolina (Bailey 1913, Potter et al. 1980). <br/><br/>Nests are placed most often in conifers (Harrison 1978, 1979), on horizontal limbs from two to 15 m from the ground (Harrison 1979, Peck and James 1987). In Ontario, nests were found in black and white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>) (14 nests), jack pine (<i>Pinus banksiana</i>) (two nests), and balsam fir (one nest) (Peck and James 1987). Adirondack nests were built on an outer branch from 7.6-13.7 m high in balsam fir or spruce (Peterson 1988). Even though the nest is bulky, it is well concealed and rather difficult to find. <br/><br/>NON-BREEDING: Includes a variety of forest, woodland, and open situations with scattered trees, especially where tall dead snags are present (AOU 1983). Primary habitat is mature, evergreen montane forest (Altman 1997). Migrants in Costa Rica occur almost anywhere, in exposed snags and open branches; in winter mostly around edges and clearings, or broken canopy of highland forest and semi-open areas (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Circus hudsonius,"BREEDING: Inhabits a wide variety of wooded upland and lowland habitats including deciduous, coniferous, or mixed forests (Bond 1957, McCarty 1996). Occurs most frequently in forests with some degree of openness, whether it be the result of forest structure, natural disturbance, or human alteration (Palmer-Ball 1996). Intermediate-aged forests with a relatively sparse midstory are preferred (Crawford et al. 1981, Johnston and Odum 1956). Territories in such forests can be equally abundant under both an open or closed canopy (Johnston 1971). However, under some circumstances may be absent from closed-canopied forests (Hespenheide 1971). Tends to inhabit edges of younger forests having a relatively dense midstory (Palmer-Ball 1996, Strelke and Dickson 1980). Also occurs in anthropogenic habitats providing an open forested aspect such as parks and suburban neighborhoods (Palmer-Ball 1996). Nest is constructed atop a horizontal branch, 1.2-21.4 meters above the ground, in a wide variety of deciduous and coniferous trees (McCarty 1996, Terres 1991). NON-BREEDING: During migration through Central America, inhabits edges, clearings, and canopy of tall forest to second-growth scrub forest (Blake and Loiselle 1992, Greenberg 1992, Stiles and Skutch 1989). On wintering grounds inhabits secondary forest as well as edges or canopy gaps of primary forest (Fitzpatrick 1980, Pearson 1980, Stotz et al. 1992)."
Cistothorus palustris,"Riverine forest, cypress swamp, deciduous woodland, farmland (Sibley and Monroe 1990)."
Cistothorus palustris griseus,"Nearly ubiquitous except in heavily forested regions; more common in lowland than in highland habitats. More abundant toward the coast in eastern North America. Most abundant around human habitation in much of Central and South American range (Palmer 1988). <br><br>In Pennsylvania, selected large conifers for mid-winter roost (Wright et al. 1986). <br><br>Eggs are laid usually in a thicket or on a cliff ledge, also in cave or other situations (e.g., on bare ground at bottom of stump, in hollow log or tree, among rocks, etc.) (Jackson 1983); also sometimes in high buildings (Lima, Peru) (Palmer 1988). In Maryland/Pennsylvania, nested in areas that were roadless, forested, and undeveloped (Coleman and Fraser 1989)."
Cistothorus stellaris,"Nests in coniferous forests and woodlands. In migration and winter it also inhabits deciduous woodlands, shrubs and thickets and may be found in old fields, gardens, yards and parks. BREEDING: Nests in coniferous trees (usually spruce), 1-30 m above ground. Nest usually hangs from stem or twig fork, occasionally it saddles a branch."
Clangula hyemalis,"Open forest and woodland used for nesting and roosting, increasing in urban and suburban areas; open and partly open country for foraging, including agricultural lands, urban areas, orchards, and tidal flats; coastal tidelands near coniferous woodland or forest edge in coastal Alaska and Pacific Northwest; restricted mostly to riparian woodland and adjacent areas in arid regions (AOS 2020)."
Coccothraustes vespertinus,"Various situations from lowlands to mountains, open country to forested regions, and humid regions to desert; most frequently in hilly or mountainous areas, especially in vicinity of cliffs (AOU 1983). Closely associated with humans along Beaufort Sea coast of Alaska (Johnson and Herter 1989). <br><br>Nests usually on cliff ledges or in coniferous trees, also on man-made structures. See White and Tanner-White (1988) for information on the use of highway overpasses and billboards for nesting in Idaho and Utah. Often reuses nests in successive years."
Coccyzus americanus,"Beaches, bays, lagoons, inlets, swamps, near marshes, and, less frequently, deciduous or coniferous woodland. In inland situations, primarily in baldcypress swamps and along major watercourses; also garbage dumps and towns (McNair 1989). Nests in tree, usually high, but sometimes as low as 2 m (Harrison 1978)."
Coccyzus erythropthalmus,"BREEDING: Emergent wetlands, grass or sedge marshes and wet meadows in freshwater situations. Some breeding territories in these wet meadows contain firm footing and only a few remnant pools of water (Berkey 1991). These areas can range from damp to 38 cm (15 inches) of water but the average depth used for nesting is 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) (Savaloja 1981). Choose shallow water habitats over deep marsh zones. The vegetation ranges in height from about 5 to over 60 cm (2 to over 24 inches). This variation depends on the area and the time of year. In Minnesota, nest in large marshes composed of mixed sedge and bulrush, with cattails in deeper areas (Hanowski and Niemi 1990). The largest populations in North Dakota are in fens (bogs) with thick, soft mats of dead vegetation (Berkey 1991). In Manitoba, the birds are found in small boggy areas (Savaloja 1981). In the Great Lakes Region, nearly exclusively associated with CAREX spp. (Evers 1990). In Michigan, nest sites predominantly among the sedge CAREX LASIOCARPA (Bart et al. 1984, Bookhout and Stenzel 1987, Brewer et al. 1991). In Maine, found in damp, low-lying areas with water depths of 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches) in otherwise dried-out portions of floodplains with a senescent mat composed of previous year's sedge growth (Gibbs et al. 1991). Habitats in Maine contained low densities of sedge, rush, and grass stems compared to other areas. Birds will use freshly burned area for territories only if burned after they have arrived to the breeding area (Savaloja 1981). NON-BREEDING: grain fields in winter and when migrating. Winters in both freshwater and brackish marshes, as well as in dense, deep grass. During fall migration, will use many open habitats, from rice paddies to dry hayfields. Winters are spent in a variety of areas, including salt-marshes, grain fields, damp grassy meadows, and freshwater marshes. In the south, the bird winters in agricultural fields and occasionally in rice fields (Berkey 1991)."
Colaptes auratus,"Primarily deciduous or mixed forest, open woodland, parks, residential areas with trees; less frequently in open situations with scattered trees. Nests commonly in crotch or on branch of tree, bush or vine, often 3-8 m above ground; both sexes build nest; sometimes reuses nest."
Colinus virginianus,"Lakes, sloughs, rivers, sometimes fields, in migration. Open tundra marshy lakes and ponds and sluggish streams in summer. Shallow lakes, ponds, and estuaries in winter. Breeds on tundra near open water. Usually nests on islets or along shoreline of ponds, but may nest as far as 1/2 mile from water. The nest is a mound (1-2 ft x 2-3 ft) of mosses, grasses, and sedges (Terres 1980). Same site may be used in successive years."
Columba livia,"Shallow fresh and brackish waters, preferring marshes, lagoons, wet cultivated fields, and occasionally forest (AOU 1983). Closely associated with rice culture in some areas (e.g., Florida). Generally on ground or in water; seldom perches in trees. Nests on hummocks among reeds and marshy vegetation (AOU 1983), in areas between ponds and swamps, or on levees and dikes and on rafts a few inches or more above water in flooded fields (Harrison 1979). Commonly lays eggs in the nests of other fulvous whistling ducks, sometimes in nests of ruddy duck and redhead."
Columbina passerina,"Breeding habitat includes tall grass areas, flooded meadows, prairie, deep cultivated grains, and hayfields (AOU 1998). In New York, old hayfields, at least 8 years since planting and including a minimum of alfalfa, were important nesting habitat (Bollinger and Gavin 1992). Nests are on the ground in small hollows in areas of concealing herbaceous vegetation. Individuals tend to return to breed in the same area in successive years, especially if that site has had good bobolink productivity (Bollinger and Gavin 1989). <br><br>This species generally selects habitat with moderate to tall vegetation, moderate to dense vegetation, and moderately deep litter (Tester and Marshall 1961, Bent 1958, Harrison 1974, Bollinger 1995), lacking oody vegetation (Sample 1989, Bollinger and Gavin 1992). It is found in native and tame grasslands, haylands, lightly to moderately grazed pastures, no-till cropland, small-grain fields, oldfields, wet meadows, and planted cover (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program [CRP] fields, Permanent Cover Program [PCP] fields, and Dense Nesting Cover [DNC]) (Bent 1958; Speirs and Orenstein 1967; Birkenholz 1973; Harrison 1974; Skinner 1974, 1975; Stewart 1975; Joyner 1978; Johnsgard 1979, 1980; Faanes 1981; Kantrud 1981; Kantrud and Kologiski 1982; Renken 1983; Huber and Steuter 1984; Basore et al. 1986; Renken and Dinsmore 1987; Bollinger 1988, 1991, 1995; Sample 1989; Bollinger et al. 1990; Messmer 1990; Herkert 1991a, 1994a,1997; Bollinger and Gavin 1992; Bock et al. 1993; Johnson and Schwartz 1993; Dhol et al. 1994; Hartley 1994; Jones 1994; King and Savidge 1995; Madden 1996; Patterson and Best 1996; Prescott and Murphy 1996; Best et al. 1997; Dale et al. 1997; Delisle and Savidge 1997; McMaster and Davis 1998; Schneider 1998). Commonly it occurs in areas with high percent grass cover and moderate percent forb cover (Wiens 1969, Skinner 1974, Renken 1983, Renken and Dinsmore 1987, Sample 1989, Herkert 1994a, Madden 1996). Bollinger (1988, 1995) noted preference for haylands with high grass-to-forb ratios and avoidance of haylands with high legume-to-grass ratios; however, a forb component was beneficial for nesting cover. <br><br>Within mixed-grass pastures in North Dakota, abundance was positively associated with percent grass cover, litter depth, density of low-growing shrubs (western snowberry, <i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>; silverberry, <i>Elaeagnus commutata</i>), vegetation density, and plant communities dominated by Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>) and native grasses (<i>Stipa</i>, <i>Bouteloua</i>, <i>Koeleria</i>, and <i>Schizachyrium</i>) (Schneider 1998). Abundance was negatively associated with percent clubmoss (<i>Selaginella densa</i>) cover, bare ground, and plant communities dominated solely by native grass. Strongest vegetational predictors of the presence of bobolinks were decreasing bare ground, increasing litter, and increasing vegetation density. Madden (1996) found that the best predictors of occurrence in North Dakota mixed-grass prairie were increasing amounts of forb and grass cover, decreasing amounts of shrub cover, and decreasing frequency of native grasses. <br><br>In Illinois tallgrass prairie fragments, the best predictors of occurrence were mean number of live forb contacts, mean vegetation height, and mean grass height (Herkert 1994a). In another Illinois study, occurred only in patches of Kentucky bluegrass and were absent from tallgrass prairie (Birkenholz 1973). <br><br>In Nebraska, abundance in CRP planted to cool-season grasses was significantly and positively correlated with percent litter cover and negatively correlated with vertical density of vegetation (measured using a Robel pole) (Delisle and Savidge 1997). In tame CRP grasslands in Iowa, abundance was positively correlated with litter cover and grass canopy cover and negatively correlated with forb cover and the horizontal patchiness of vegetation (Patterson and Best 1996). Abundance in Wisconsin was highest in cool-season grasses, followed by wet pastures, bluegrass (Poa)/quackgrass (<i>Agropyron repens</i>) communities, and alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>/grass hayfields (Sample 1989). In New York tame hayfields, increased in abundance as the hayfields aged (Bollinger 1988, 1995). Older hayfields (more than 3 years old) were characterized by sparse, patchy, grass-dominated vegetation and high litter cover. <br><br>In Nebraska, boblinks nested in wet prairie, alfalfa, upland native prairie, domestic hayland, and wheat (Faanes and Lingle 1995). In Iowa they nested under or near native bluestem (<i>Andropogon </i>or <i>Schizachyrium</i> not specified) or Kentucky bluegrass (Kendeigh 1941). In Wisconsin boblinks nested at the bases of large forbs (Martin 1971). In Montana, nested in a wet-meadow pasture (Silloway 1904). In Ontario, they nested in a weedy meadow near a wetland; nests were built in the litter layer, had a canopy of dead grasses, and were surrounded by living vegetation 33-41 centimeters tall (Boyer and Devitt 1961, Joyner 1978). Boblinks have been found nesting in CRP fields in Iowa and Michigan (Best et al. 1997). <br><br>Boblinks occasionally nest in cropland. In Iowa, they nested at low densities in untilled fields of corn that were idle in the fall and spring and contained year-round crop residue, rather than in tilled fields or strip cover (Basore et al. 1986). In Wisconsin, a few were found in small-grain fields, but none were found in rowcrops (Sample 1989). Graber and Graber (1963) reported fairly heavy use of small grain fields in Illinois. The species was absent from cropland in Saskatchewan and Manitoba (Hartley 1994, Jones 1994). <br><br>During the nonbreeding season, boblinks also occur in rice fields, marshes, and open woody areas (AOU 1983).<br>In Argentina, bobolinks primarily use natural wet grassland habitats associated with main rivers and huge marshes (Di Giacomo et al. 2005)."
Contopus cooperi,"Habitat consists of open, mature pine woodlands, rarely deciduous or mixed pine-hardwoods located near pine woodlands (Steirly 1957, Hooper et al. 1980, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1980, Kalisz and Boettcher 1991). Optimal habitat is characterized as a broad savanna with a scattered overstory of large pines and a dense groundcover containing a diversity of grass, forb, and shrub species (Hooper et al. 1980, AOU 1991). Midstory vegetation is sparse or absent (Hooper et al. 1980, Locke et al. 1983, Hooper et al. 1991, Loeb et al. 1993).<br /><br />The open, park-like characteristic of the habitat is maintained by low intensity fires, which occurred historically during the growing season at intervals of about 1-10 years (Christensen 1981, SNN 1990) or more recently recommended intervals of 1-3 years (FNAI 2010), evidenced by the rapid invasion of hardwoods into pine savannas following fire exclusion for brief periods (less than 10 years) or within five years of fire exclusion at a north Florida site (Engstrom et al. 1994), the high annual frequency of lightning strikes in these habitats in summer (Platt 1988), and the pyrogenic nature of characteristic plant species such as longleaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i>) (Rebertus et al. 1989) and wiregrass (<i>Aristida stricta</i>) (Platt et al. 1988). AOU (1991) concluded that this bird ""...is a symbol of fire-maintained, old-growth pine savannas, once the dominant ecosystem in the Southeast.""<br /><br />CAVITY TREES<br /><br />Nesting and roosting occur in tree cavities. Active cavity trees are almost exclusively old, living, flat-topped pine trees (but see Patterson and Robertson 1983, Hooper 1982). Typical noncavity roosts include scars on the trunks of trees, forks on live pines (Hooper and Lennartz 1983), and the underside of large limbs (Baker, pers. comm.). However, juveniles often investigate dead trees and may roost in them until they obtain a cavity in a living tree (Ligon 1970).<br /><br />Excavation through the sap wood appears to limit the speed with which cavities are constructed, perhaps because sap leaking into the tunnel interrupts excavation (Hooper et al. 1980, Walters 1991). The tunnel is excavated back into the tree at an upward slope such that resin or pitch from the sapwood drains from the hole, and that rain water is prevented from collecting in the cavity (Ligon et al. 1980, Jackson 1978b). Even so, Teulings (1973) reported that many nest cavities were flooded with rain following violent storms.<br /><br />Once birds have tunneled through the sapwood and into the heartwood, they excavate downward forming a gourd-shaped chamber 15-25 cm deep and 1.7- 12.7 cm wide. The girth of the tree must be wide enough to allow the central chamber to be excavated in the resin-less heartwood, hence one of the reasons for selecting old trees (Ligon et al. 1980).<br /><br />Roosting and nesting cavities have been found in longleaf, loblolly (<i>Pinus taeda</i>), shortleaf (<i>P. echinata</i>), slash (<i>P. elliottii</i>), pond pine (<i>P. serotina</i>), pitch pine (<i>P. rigida</i>), and even bald cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>) (Dennis 1971). Some evidence suggests longleaf pine is preferred even when mature stands of other pine species are available (Hopkins and Lynn 1971, Lay and Sweptson 1973, Baker 1981, Lennartz et al. 1983, Hovis and Labisky 1985, Ligon et al. 1986). The historic distribution of longleaf coincides with the region where Audubon (1839) reported the greatest abundance of red-cockaded Woodpeckers. In addition, relict stands of old-growth longleaf today have some of the highest densities of this species (Engstrom 1982, Carter et al. 1983).<br /><br />Even so, other species such as shortleaf and loblolly pine are important in areas where longleaf pine is uncommon or absent (Jackson 1971, Wood 1983a, Shapiro 1983).<br /><br />Red-cockaded woodpeckers show a clear preference for older trees (Jackson et al. 1979, Jackson and Jackson 1986, Delotelle and Epting 1988, Engstrom and Evans 1990), contrary to conclusions reached by Field and Williams (1985). The average age of cavity trees ranges from 63-126 years for longleaf pine, 70-90 years for loblolly pine, 75-149 years for shortleaf pine, 62-130 years for pond pine, and &gt;70 years for slash pine (Hooper et al. 1980).<br /><br />The diameter of cavity trees at breast height (dbh) is usually at least 35 cm (Lay and Russel 1970, Jones and Ott 1973, Hovis and Labisky 1985), except in south Florida where cavity trees averaged only about 25 cm dbh (Shapiro 1983, Delotelle et al. 1983, Beaver and Dryden 1992) and may be as small as 15.4 cm dbh (Beaver and Dryden 1992).<br /><br />Cavity trees are generally infected with red heart disease, a fungus (<i>Phellinus pini</i>) that attacks the heartwood, destroys cell walls, and causes the wood to become soft and pithy (Steirly 1957). Conner and Locke (1982) also found cavities in wood infected by one of four other fungi species. Although red heart disease is apparently not a strict prerequisite for cavity excavation (Conner and Locke 1982, Beckett 1971, Jackson 1977), Hooper et al. (1991) suggested there is a universal preference for trees with decayed heartwood. An independent group of researchers agreed with this statement (SNN 1990).<br /><br />In addition to requirements for old pine trees, appropriate habitat also includes open, park-like conditions extending across the area surrounding a cluster of cavity trees Walters (1991).<br /><br />Shapiro (1983) found that the average minimum distance between cavity trees was 104 m in south Florida, whereas Wood (1983) reported an average minimum distance of only 58 m in Oklahoma.<br /><br />Various measurements of the vegetative structure surrounding clusters of cavities have been compared with different types of control sites lacking woodpeckers. However, the fidelity this species shows to cavity sites (Harlow 1983, Nesbitt et al. 1983a, Lennartz et al. 1987, Walters 1991), coupled with social interactions (Walters 1990), mean that measurements around ""active cavities"" may not indicate productive habitat (Hooper et al. 1980, Walters 1990, Walters 1991); a pair of birds or a solitary male, and even some nesting groups may remain at a cavity associated with low-quality habitat for many years (Walters 1989, 1991).<br /><br />The basal area of pine overstory is one of the more important habitat components within cavity clusters. Hooper et al. (1980) maintained that appropriate conditions require a mature pine stand (more than 70 years old) with a stocking density of 11.5-18 sq m of overstory pines per ha. This stocking density is relatively high compared to that recommended by others. Conner and O'Halloran (1987) recommended a pine basal area of 9-14 sq m per ha, while Hovis and Labisky (1985) recommended about 12 sq m per ha. The Recovery Plan (Lennartz and Henry 1985) recommended that cavity clusters have a pine basal area of 5.8-8.4 sq m per ha. The basal area of pines reported from studies in south and central Florida is much less than suggested by Hooper et al. (1980), averaging 4.0-7.0 sq m per ha (Delotelle et al. 1983, Shapiro 1983, Nesbitt et al. 1983b).<br /><br />Multivariate techniques have been used to quantify habitat conditions surrounding active cavity clusters. Locke et al. (1983) measured 29 vegetative variables in a 0.04 ha area around active cavity trees and compared these with measurements at randomly selected old pines. Four variables were correlated with active sites: 1) the total number of hardwood trees (6.4 in occupied sites versus 12.8 in random sites); 2) the number of understory pines (6.9 in occupied sites versus 3.5 in control); 3) the mean ratio of bole length to height of pines greater than 28 cm diameter breast height (0.48 in occupied sites versus 0.43 in random sites); and 4) the number of midstory hardwoods (1.1 in occupied sites versus 1.8 in random sites).<br /><br />FORAGING HABITAT<br /><br />Less is known about foraging habitat than about conditions needed around cavity clusters. Hooper et al. (1980) stated that ""... the best cavity site is no good if adequate foraging habitat is unavailable."" Recent studies (Delotelle et al. 1983, Hovis and Labisky 1985, Conner and Rudolph 1991b, Loeb et al. 1992) and anecdotal evidence provide some general indication of the importance of foraging habitat. However, this species appears to use a wide range of pine and hardwood habitats (Hooper et al. 1980, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1985), and foraging behavior is influenced by conspecifics, group size, and many other factors (Conner and Rudolph 1991b, Walters 1991). These conditions make it difficult to ascertain with certainty the importance of specific habitat features within foraging areas.<br /><br />Several lines of evidence point to a problem with large cleared tracts. Walters (pers. comm.) monitored a population of 12 cavity clusters for 9 years and found the population to be stable until logging cleared much of the foraging habitat in the area. Soon afterwards, the population showed signs of falling apart. Hooper et al. (1980) reported that sites were abandoned where extensive clear cuts were created within the foraging area. They also proposed that, when clearing reduces the foraging habitat to less than 40 ha, persisting groups may have difficulty raising young. Conner and Rudolph (1991b) found that the removal of forest cover within 800 m of cavity clusters was associated with cluster inactivation. The effects of forest removal were particularly noticeable in small populations.<br /><br />Foraging occurs in a diversity of forested habitat types that includes pines of various ages as well as some hardwood-dominated habitats. Despite this seemingly catholic use of different habitat types, most foraging appears to take place on older pine trees or in open pine habitats (Baker and Thompson 1971, Hooper et al. 1980, Hooper and Lennartz 1981, Delotelle 1983).<br /><br />Delotelle et al. (1983) found that live pine stems greater than 23 cm dbh represented only 19% of available foraging substrate in central Florida but received 65% of the use, and also found that longleaf pine was used as the foraging substrate 90% of the time.<br /><br />Similarly, Porter and Labisky (1986) found that longleaf pines made up only 40% of their study area yet were the foraging substrate approximately 77% of the time.<br /><br />As described elsewhere, females forage on trunks more often than do males, and an abundance of trees with large trunk surfaces may be more important to females; Jackson (pers. comm.) suggested that females lost weight after pines larger than 25 cm dbh were removed from all but a small buffer surrounding cavity trees..<br /><br />Other evidence supporting the need for foraging habitat consisting of large areas of old pines lies in the fact that the largest populations occur where old-growth pine trees and low hardwood densities extend throughout a broad area (Engstrom 1982, Hooper et al. 1980, Delotelle et al. 1983, Conner and Rudolph 1991a).<br /><br />The Recovery Plan (Lennartz and Henry 1985) suggested suitable foraging habitat requires 6350 stems &gt; 25.4 cm diameter at breast height, and 796 sq m basal area of pine stems in stands &gt;30 years old within 1.3 km (0.5 miles) of a cavity cluster. These values do not apply in south Florida (Beaver and Dryden 1992) where birds use larger areas.<br /><br />LANDSCAPE HABITAT FEAUnrankable RES<br /><br />Landscape features, such as fragmentation of foraging habitat, total area of foraging habitat, percentage of pinewood or hardwood cover, contiguity of the canopy and forest cover, and habitat patch size and shape may affect the habitat quality (Hooper et al. 1980, SNN 1990, Conner and Rudolph 1991b). The importance of such variables is not well known (Walters 1991), but a growing body of research focuses on this issue, particularly on some public lands where timber harvest patterns may create unfavorable landscapes (Conner and Rudolph 1991b). A potential problem in such research is the key role that cavity trees play in determining whether an area is ever actually used by red- cockaded woodpeckers (Walters 1991). Areas that have suitable habitat characteristics, yet lack suitable cavity trees, will not likely be occupied by red-cockaded woodpeckers (Walters 1991), and thus some comparisons will be misleading.<br /><br />Seagle et al. (1992) compared characteristics of forest compartments with active colonies and those having no colonies. Active clusters were associated with: 1) an increased acreage of mature longleaf pine; 2) an increased acreage of all pine species; 3) a decreased percentage of acres of longleaf, loblolly, and slash pines in stands less than 20 acres in size; 4) a decreased percentage of acres of mature loblolly pine; and 5) a decreased acreage of loblolly pine between ages 20 and 39 years.<br /><br />Conner and Rudolph (1991b) found that foraging habitat could be fragmented and isolated as a result of forest-harvest patterns, and that larger groups of woodpeckers had consistently fewer clear cuts near cavity sites. Fragmentation did not appear to have an effect on dispersal (e.g., the ability of dispersing females to find unmated males), but it did apparently affect the quality of foraging habitat. Conner and Rudolph (1991b) warned that it may be possible to have a sufficient quantity of foraging habitat within 800 m of an active cluster but still have insufficient arrangement of foraging habitat. Fragmentation influenced a group's access to foraging habitat by forcing birds to go through territories of adjacent groups. This increases the probability of cluster inactivation."
Contopus virens,"Deciduous and mixed woodland, second growth, parks, orchards, swamps, and riparian woodland. Nests mostly in hole dug by both sexes in dead stub of tree, also in live tree (especially dead part), fenceposts; 1-15 m above ground."
Conuropsis carolinensis,"Forest, open woodland, swamps, well-wooded towns and parks, open situations with scattered trees. Most abundant in mature woods with large old trees suitable for cavity nesting; also common in medium-aged forests; prefers woods with a dense canopy (Bushman and Therres 1988). Uses tree cavities for roosting and winter cover; may excavate new cavities in fall to be used for roosting (Sousa 1987). Sleeps singly in holes usually carved by males (Stiles and Skutch 1989). In the eastern U.S., uses forest areas of 2-4 ha or larger, though a much larger area (maybe 12 ha) may be needed to support a viable breeding population; in Iowa the minimum width of riparian forest necessary to support a breeding population was 40 m (Sousa 1987). Overall, appears to be minimally impacted by forest fragmentation, though a few studies have reported a decline in numbers as forest patch size decreases; the presence of suitable cavity trees is a more important consideration (see Bushman and Therres 1988). <br><br>Nests in hole dug mostly by male in live or dead tree or stub, 1.5-18 m (average 9 m) above ground. In most areas, favors dead or dying parts of live trees, especially where fungal heart rot has softened the heartwood. Snag (25 cm or more in DBH) density of 5/ha assumed optimal for reproduction (but may not be adequate for foraging) (Sousa 1987). Nest tree DBH minimally 20 cm; averaged 27-28 cm in New England, 38 cm in Colorado, 41 cm in Virginia, 44 cm in California, and 92 cm in Oregon (Sousa 1987). See Sousa (1987) for fairly detailed summary of nesting habitat characteristics in different regions. Usually excavates new nest hole each year. May nest in utility pole or bird box."
Coragyps atratus,"Dense deciduous (favored in southeast), coniferous (favored in north, northwest and west), or mixed forest, open woodland, second growth, and (locally) parks and wooded residential areas of towns. Prefers woods with a tall closed canopy and a high basal area. Most often in areas of extensive forest or minimal isolation from extensive forest. Uses a minimum of 4 cavities per year (only one for raising brood). <br><br>In Missouri, abundance increased with area covered with bottomland forest, density of trees at least 30 cm dbh, and density of snags at least 54 cm dbh (Renken and Wiggers 1993). In West Virginia found in all forest types, at all elevations, but less common in spruce-northern hardwoods forest and most common in mixed hardwood forest (Hall 1983). <br><br>Nests are in cavities excavated by both sexes usually in dead stubs in shaded places; cavity entrance averages about 14 m above ground (see photos and descriptions in Harrison 1975, 1979). Usually digs a new hole for each year's brood, but the same cavity may be used for several years. Nest tree species and size varies among regions and even within regions depending on site and availability. In southern British Columbia, preferred nest sites were in live aspen with heartwood decay, in trees larger than 40 cm dbh (Harestad and Keisker 1989). In northwest Montana, most of 54 nest trees were large western larch (LARIX OCCIDENTALIS) and nest trees averaged 74.9 cm dbh (McClelland 1979). In northeast Oregon, 75% of nest trees were ponderosa pine (PINUS PONDEROSA) and mean dbh of nest trees was 84 cm (Bull 1987). In western Oregon, 73% of nest trees were Douglas-fir (PSEUDOTSUGA MENZIESII) and nest trees averaged 69 cm dbh (Mellen 1987). In Virginia, 28% of nest trees were hickory (CARYA spp.), 22% red oak (QUERCUS RUBRA), 17% chestnut oak (Q. PRINUS) and nest trees averaged 54.6 cm dbh (Conner et al. 1975). Most studies report nests 5-17 m above ground in wood softened by fungal rot, in trees usually 100-180 years old, over 51 cm DBH, 12-21 m tall, and often near permanent water (Bushman and Therres 1988)."
Corthylio calendula,"Thickets, dense brushy and shrubby areas, undergrowth of forest edge, hedgerows, and gardens (AOU 1983), dense second growth. <br><br>Nests in dense thickets, briars, vine tangles, shrubs, low trees, typically 1-3 m above ground (Harrison 1979)."
Corvus brachyrhynchos,"An occupant of the virgin deciduous forests of eastern North America, especially those containing beech, oak, chestnut, and/or hickory; nested in colonies wherever food was available."
Corvus corax,"Marshes, ponds, lakes, meadows, mudflats, lagoons, streams, mangrove lagoons, and other bodies of calm shallow water; primarily in freshwater habitats. <br><br>Nests in trees and shrubs to about 4 m above ground or water, primarily in freshwater situations; usually in mangroves in the tropics. Often nests with other herons, egrets, and/or ibises."
Corvus ossifragus,"FORAGING: Shallow water (usually less than 15 centimeters deep); saline, hypersaline, or brackish coastal habitats including barren sand or mud tidal flats, salt ponds, lagoons, and open red mangrove (RHIZOPHORA MANGLE) and black mangrove (AVICENNIA GERMINANS) communities (Paul 1991, Stevenson and Anderson 1994, Stiles and Skutch 1989). Occasionally feeds in other habitats including coastal beaches, sparsely-vegetated freshwater marshes, and the shores of lake and reservoirs (Paul 1991). <br><br>NESTING: Typically nests on natural islands or man-made dredge spoil islands, but occasionally nests on the coastal mainland (Paul 1991). Nests are generally constructed in red, black, and white (LAUnrankable NCULARIA RACEMOSA) mangroves, but also in terrestrial vegetation including Brazilian pepper (SCHINUS TEREBINTHEFOLIUS), cactus (OPUNTIA spp.), mesquite (PROSOPIS spp.), huisache (ACACIA spp.), ragweed (AMBROSIA ARTEMISIIFOLIA), sea oxeye daisy (BORRICHIA FRUTESCENS), sea purslane (SESUVIUM PORUnrankable LACASTRUM), camphor daisy (MACHAERANTHERA PHYLLOCEPHALA), and spanish bayonet (YUCCA spp.). Nests are generally constructed less than 3 meters above the ground or water, but can be as high as 6 meters (McMurray 1971, Stevenson and Anderson 1994). Sometimes nests are placed on the ground among low vegetation or on bare sand or shell beach ridges (Bent 1926, McMurray 1971, Paul 1991, Paul et al. 1979, Simersky 1971, Stevenson and Anderson 1994, Toland 1991)."
Coturnicops noveboracensis,"Marshes, lakes, ponds, lagoons, mangroves, and shallow coastal habitats. <br><br>Nests in trees or shrubs or, in some areas, on ground or in marsh vegetation. Often nests with other colonial water birds. Nests over water or ground. See references in Spendelow and Patton (1988) for further details."
Cyanocitta cristata,"Marshes, ponds, sloughs, bayous, rivers, mangrove swamps, saltwater lagoons, islands; salt and fresh water. <br><br>Nests mainly near salt water in mangroves or buttonwood, in thickets of tidal marshes, willow thickets or rushes of freshwater marshes, on Texas island sites in dry thickets, large cane, and prickly pear, and on bare coastal islands in grass. Nests often with other herons/egrets."
Cygnus columbianus,"This species occupies diverse vegetation types, from sea level to elevations up to 1,850 meters; occasionally individuals wander up to 3,000 meters (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Key features of habitat include tall, accessible trees for nesting and open areas for foraging; arid areas are avoided (Meyer 1995). In the United States, nesting and foraging habitats include various pine forests and savannas, cypress swamps and savannas, cypress-hardwood swamps, hardwood hammocks, mangrove (<i>Avicennia</i>) swamps, narrow riparian forests, prairies, and freshwater and brackish marshes. In the tropics, this kite occurs in humid lowland and upland forests, riparian forests, cloud forests, and pine forests (Meyer 1995, Stiles and Skutch 1989). <br><br>Nests are near the tops of trees that are higher than the surrounding stand, presumably to provide easier access to the nest (Brown et al. 1997, Snyder 1974, Meyer 1995, Meyer and Collopy 1995). In south Florida, nest trees were significantly taller than random trees (Meyer and Collopy 1995). Nests most often are 8-38 meters above the ground (Brown et al. 1997, Snyder 1974, Stiles and Skutch 1989). The average nest height in South Carolina was 23 meters; in Florida mean nest height ranged from 18.2-21.7 meters (Cely and Sorrow 1990, Meyer and Collopy 1995). <br><br>Pines are the preferred nest trees. Of 151 U.S. nests, 86 percent were in pines, 7 percent in cypress (<i>Taxodium </i>spp.) and 7 percent in mangrove (Meyer 1995). Most nests in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana were in loblolly pine (<i>Pinus taeda</i>; Cely and Sorrow 1990, Meyer 1995). Elsewhere in Louisiana and Texas, nests have been found in cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i>) and water oak (<i>Quercus nigra</i>; Brown et al. 1997, Meyer 1995). In south Florida, 51 percent of nests were in slash pine (<i>Pinus elliottii</i>), 37 percent in cypress, 12 percent in Australian pine (<i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>) and 6 percent in bay (<i>Persea </i>spp.; Meyer 1995)."
Dendrocygna bicolor,"Brushy and scrubby growth, thickets, deciduous forest edge, open second growth, and swamps. Nonbreeding: also woodland, but migrants seldom enter tall shady second growth or woodland (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests in damp thickets of alder and various shrubs, in bogs, along marshy borders of lakes, and in brush along stream banks, less than 2 m above ground (Harrison 1979)."
Dolichonyx oryzivorus,"Damp coniferous forest, swamps, bogs. In migration in various habitats from low scrub to forest; in winter prefers understory of primary or secondary forest, scrubby woodland, and shady clearings (Stiles and Skutch 1989), commonly in humid lowland forest and open woodland. Nests on or near ground, in side of mossy mound or among roots of upturned tree, usually well hidden in sphagnum moss or growing herbage."
Dryobates borealis,"Open woodland and brushy areas, forest borders, thinned woodland, tall second growth. In maple forests in Quebec, occurred where trees were the tallest, sugar maple was in nearly pure stand, and subcanopy was sparse (Darveau 1992). <br><br>Nests in poplar woodland, deciduous scrub, forest edge, parks, old orchards, roadside shade trees, and gardens; in crotch or on limb of tree (often deciduous) or shrub, often 3-6 m above ground."
Dryobates pubescens,"BREEDING: Strongly tied to brushy areas of willow (SALIX spp.) and similar shrubs. Found in thickets, open second growth with brush, swamps, wetlands, streamsides, and open woodland (AOU 1983). Common in mountain meadows and along streams; also in brushy upland pastures (especially hawthorn) and orchards (NGS 1983). The presence of water (running water, pools, or saturated soils) and willow, alder (ALNUS spp), or other deciduous riparian shrubs are essential habitat elements (Sanders and Flett 1989, USDA Forest Service 1994). Occurs in both mesic and drier upland conditions, but apparently reaches highest densities on wet sites (Sedgwick and Knopf 1992). It is associated with dense riparian deciduous shrub cover separated by open areas, but large contiguous willow thickets without openings are typically avoided; it does not occur in dense tree cover but will use scattered trees for song and foraging perches and gleaning substrate (USDA Forest Service 1994). Habitat preferences may overlap with alder (EMPIDONAX ALNORUM) and least flycatchers (EMPIDONAX MINIMUS), to include deciduous woods and thickets, bottomlands and swamps (Griggs 1997). Foraging habitat may overlap with western flycatcher (EMPIDONAX DIFFICILIS; Frakes and Johnson 1982). <br><br>In southwestern Ontario, generally occurs in more xeric upland sites, but in some areas uses boggy alder thickets, overlapping with alder flycatcher (Barlow and McGillivray 1983). In the Sierra Nevada of California, broad, flat meadows with willows and water are essential (Sanders and Flett 1989). In the Northern Rockies, is apparently restricted to riparian areas with adequate shrub cover (Hutto and Young 1999). <br><br>In Colorado, males and females were found to select for different habitat attributes: female-selected nest sites typically had dense willows and were similar in patch size and bush height, male-selected song perch sites were characterized by large central shrubs and high variability in shrub size. On an increasing scale, breeding sites were respectively characterized by greater willow density, larger willow patches with smaller gaps, and greater percent willow coverage than non-willow coverage (Sedgwick and Knopf 1992). <br><br>Southwestern willow flycatcher (E. T. EXTIMUS) breeds only in dense riparian vegetation near water or saturated soil. Habitat typically contains dense vegetation in the patch interior, often interspersed with small openings, sparser vegetation, or open water that creates a habitat mosaic of variable density. It nests in shrub and tree thickets 4-7 meters tall, with dense foliage 0-4 meters above the ground, and usually a high canopy coverage (USFWS 1995). The dominant plant species, size and shape of habitat patch, canopy structure and other habitat variables vary from monotypic to mixed-species stands and from simple to complex vegetation structures (Sogge et al. 1997). Habitats include dense high-elevation willow; native broadleaf shrubs and trees composed of willow, cottonwood (POPULUS spp.), boxelder (ACER NEUnrankable NDO), ash (FRAXINUS spp.), alder, or buttonbush (CEPHALANTHUS OCCIDENTALIS); monotypic closed-canopy stands of tamarisk (TAMARIX spp.) or Russian olive (ELAEAGNUS ANUnrankable STIFOLIA); or a mix of native shrubs and exotic species (Sogge et al. 1997). Along the Virgin River, Utah, is restricted to shrub communities with shrub densities ranging from 70 percent to 100 percent (Whitmore 1977). <br><br>NEST SITE: Nests primarily near slow streams, standing water or seeps, swampy thickets, especially of willow and buttonbush (AOU 1983, USDA Forest Service 1994), also dogwood (CORNUS spp.), elderberry, hawthorn, rose, tamarisk, and others; in fork or on horizontal limb of shrub, usually 1-3 meters above ground (see Harris 1991). In montane habitats, nests are usually in willows at least 2 meters high with foliage density of 50-70 percent and about 1 meter of cover above the nest (Sanders and Flett 1989). Also see Sedgwick and Knopf (1992) for information on nest sites and song perches in northcentral Colorado. <br><br>Historically, southwestern willow flycatcher primarily in willows, buttonbush, and BACCHARIS spp. with a scattered cottonwood overstory. With changes in riparian plant communities, non-native tamarisk and Russian olive provide nesting habitat in some areas (Brown 1988, USFWS 1995). Along the Colorado in the Grand Canyon, for example, the flycatcher nests in tall tamarisk within 30 meters of water (Brown 1988, Sogge et al. 1997); however it is not known if nesting success differs in tamarisk compared to native vegetation (USFWS 1996). Where E. T. EXTIMUS nests in tamarisk, the tamarisk are usually taller (more than 5 meters) and denser (90 percent canopy closure) than in tamarisk-dominated areas where the flycatcher has been extirpated, and broadleaf shrubs may also be an important part of the community (Sogge et al. 1997). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Uses same types of habitats during migration and winter as breeding season (McCabe 1991). Occurs in dense scrub, deciduous broadleaf forest, streamside gallery forest, and freshwater wetlands (Rappole et al. 1995). In western Mexico and Central America, found in humid to semi-arid scrubby fields with hedges, fences woodland and edge, plantations; frequents low to mid-vegetation levels and often comes into open (Howell and Webb 1995)."
Dryobates villosus,"BREEDING: Key habitat requirements are moist deciduous forests with a moderate understory, generally near a stream (Hamel et al. 1982). Humid deciduous forest (primarily mature), woodland, shaded ravines, floodplain forest, river swamps, hammocks and cypress bays of south, thickets, second growth, plantations. Requires a high dense canopy and an open understory (Bushman and Therres 1988). Tends to be scarce or absent in small forest tracts, unless the tract is near a larger forested area (see Bushman and Therres 1988). Floodplain forests must be more than 400-500 feet wide before they become suitable for nesting (Peterjohn and Rice 1991). <br /><br />Nests in tree in horizontal twig fork toward end of lower branch, often over water, ravine, or other clearing, usually at a height of about 2-9 m. Usually nests on a lower branch, far out from trunk; usually shaded by leafy branches. Average nest characteristics have been measured by D. R. Whitehead and G. M. Greenberg (pers. comms.) for forest interior sites in Indiana: dbh of nest tree - 12.46 cm; nest height - 5.67 m; nest tree height - 14.96 m; distance from bole - 4.37 m; distance to watercourse - 20.74 m; and slope - 18.80 degrees. Bent (1942) describes it as a bird of the forest: it is found in cypress swamps, in heavily wooded bottomlands, and in the depths of wooded ravines. Of Wisconsin, Bent (1942) writes ""The essential requirement of the Acadian Flycatcher appears to be a large tract of undisturbed timber. The typical habitat is a deep, well-wooded ravine having a rocky stream bed, which is usually dry. It may also be looked for in the heavy timber of the river bottoms and in tamarack swamps in the southern portion of the state."" Conner and Adkisson (1975) found it in mature forest with a basal area of 90 ft squared/acre (21 m squared/ha) (Bushman and Therres 1988). <br /><br />Vegetation types for the southeastern U.S. from Hanel et al. (1982), in order of suitability, are: oak-gum-cypress and elm-ash-cottonwood are listed as optimal habitat at both the sapling-poletimber, and sawtimber stages; cove hardwoods are listed as suitable at the sapling-poletimber stage and optimal at the sawtimber stage; southern mixed mesic hardwoods are listed as only marginal at the sapling-poletimber stage and optimal at the sawtimber stage; bay swamp-pocosin, oak-hickory, and white pine-hemlock are all listed as only marginal at the sapling-poletimber stage and suitable at the sawtimber stage; mixed pine-hardwood is listed as only marginal at both the sapling-poletimber and sawtimber stages. In all cases, midstory and overstory canopy are used for all activities (feeding/foraging, nesting, perching, roosting, and singing) and dead trees or limbs are used for feeding/foraging and singing. Requires snags for foraging with a minimum dbh of 6 in (15 cm) and exposed perches in the midstory (Hamel et al. 1982). D. R. Whitehead and G. M. Greenberg (pers. comms.) have observed foraging on all types of trees, but usually not snags because they sometimes pick insects off leaves. Data on habitat selection are also given by Hespenheide (1971); where Acadian Flycatchers overlap with Least Flycatchers (EMPIDONAX MINIMUS), the preferred habitat of Acadians has apparently changed in accordance with predictions of competitive effect based on overlap data alone. <br /><br />MIGRATION: Open scrub and young second growth to primary and secondary forest. <br /><br />NON-BREEDING: Little is known about this species' wintering habitat. Prefers thickets and gaps in forest understory and edge (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Common resident in understory of humid forest and second growth or cut-over woodland in Colombia (Hilty and Brown 1986). Recorded exclusively in forest in Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica (Hagan and Johnston 1992). Blake and Loiselle (1992) found them to be most common in old (30-35 year) second-growth forest habitats in Costa Rica. Here, small to medium sized trees (&lt; 25 cm dbh) were most common, as were small vines and lianas; canopy was measured as being 13% open. Also common in young (approximately 5 yr post-abandonment pasture in 1985) second- growth forest habitats; here, the canopy was 26% open and shrubs were the dominant vegetation type. Few were found in primary forest (Blake and Loiselle 1992)."
Dryocopus pileatus,"Grassland, tundra, sandy regions, areas with scattered low shrubs, desert playas, grazed pastures, stubble fields, open cultivated areas, and rarely open areas in forest (AOU 1983). Nests in hollow on ground often next to grass tuft or clod of earth or manure."
Dumetella carolinensis,"Various salt water and freshwater habitats: marshes, mangroves, lagoons, lakes, marsh prairie, pasture, coastal swamps (AOU 1983, Kushlan 1979). Often perches in trees. Nests in trees or shrubs near water, especially in wooded swamps; also on matted clumps of JUNCUS (Frederick 1987) or other marsh vegetation. May show fidelity to nest area despite chronic nest loss due to tidal washover. Typically nests with smaller EGRETTA herons (Frederick 1987)."
Ectopistes migratorius,"Breeding habitat includes moist woodland (primarily coniferous), bushy bogs and fens, and wooded edges of water courses and beaver ponds. Nests are in trees or shrubs, usually in or near water, frequently in a conifer to about 6 meters above ground. During migration and winter, habitat is primarily wooded wetlands and riparian areas but also includes various open woodlands, scrub, pastures, and cultivated lands (AOU 1983)."
Egretta caerulea,"Shrubby and bushy areas (especially near water), riparian woodland, aspen parklands, cultivated lands, marshes, and around human habitation; in migration and winter also in pastures and fields (AOU 1983). Nests in bushes and trees or on the ground, near open water, in marshes, fields, and urban areas."
Egretta rufescens,"NONBREEDING: a wide variety of habitats including marshes, deserts, seacoasts, near coastal lakes and lagoons, open woodlands, fields, etc. May roost in conifers in winter. <br><br>BREEDING: In southeastern Montana, breeding males appeared to prefer patchy shrub/grassland habitats for hunting (Becker and Sieg 1987). Urban-breeding Merlins in Saskatchewan avoided hunting in agricultural areas where prey abundance was low (Sodhi and Oliphant 1992). <br><br>Nests in conifer woodland or wooded prairie (e.g., groves of deciduous trees along rivers), including planted shelterbelts; often near water; in towns in some areas (e.g. Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan). Nests in trees in abandoned crow, magpie, hawk, or squirrel nest; also in natural tree cavity or abandoned woodpecker hole, on bare cliff ledge, or scrape on ground (arctic, heather moor of U.K.). Not infrequently returns to same nesting area in successive years."
Egretta thula,"Various open situations from tundra, moorlands, steppe, and seacoasts, especially where there are suitable nesting cliffs, to mountains, open forested regions, and human population centers (AOU 1983). When not breeding, occurs in areas where prey concentrate, including farmlands, marshes, lakeshores, river mouths, tidal flats, dunes and beaches, broad river valleys, cities, and airports. <br /><br />Often nests on ledge or hole on face of rocky cliff or crag. River banks, tundra mounds, open bogs, large stick nests of other species, tree hollows, and man-made structures (e.g., ledges of city buildings) are used locally (Cade 1982). Nests typically are situated on ledges of vertical rocky cliffs, commonly with a sheltering overhang (Palmer 1988, Campbell et al 1990). Tundra populations nests typically on rocky cliffs, bluffs, or dirt banks. Ideal locations include undisturbed areas with a wide view, near water, and close to plentiful prey. Substitute man-made sites include tall buildings, bridges, rock quarries, and raised platforms. <br /><br />See Grebence and White (1989) for information on nesting along the Colorado River system."
Egretta tricolor,"BREEDING: Open or partly open habitat; prairies, deserts, wooded streams, burned forest, cultivated lands and farmland with scattered trees, open woodland, along roads, sometimes in cities. <br><br>Nests in natural holes in trees, abandoned woodpecker holes, holes in buildings or cliffs, abandoned magpie nests, and similar sites. Readily uses nest-boxes, which may dramatically increase density of nesting pairs in some areas (may use boxes put up for wood duck or goldeneye). In western Venezuela, nest cavities tend to face into prevailing winds (Balgooyen 1990). Rarely returns to breed in vicinity where reared, but breeders tend to return to their previous territories (Palmer 1988). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Various open and semi-open habitats. In winter, males use less open habitats than do females (Smallwood 1987, Palmer 1988, Ardia and Bildstein 2001)."
Elanoides forficatus,"Mainly in coastal waters (sometimes inland over large bodies of water or in association with storms); generally within sight of land when offshore (Palmer 1962). Roosts on rocks, vegetation of offshore islands, and on rigging of boats (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests on islands in mangroves, low trees, and shrubs; usually on steep slope of offshore island (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Sensitive to disturbance; usually nests on most remote cays and islets (Raffaele 1983)."
Empidonax alnorum,"Freshwater lakes, ponds, marshes, and larger rivers, wintering also on brackish estuaries and bays. Also on land bordering these habitats. Calm open water with plenty of algae and other aquatic vegetation (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Typically builds floating nest among marsh plants in 30-100 cm of water (Harrison 1979). In south-central Saskatchewn, nesting habitat and reproductive effort and success were greatly reduced during drought (Sutherland 1991)."
Empidonax flaviventris,"ALL SEASONS: Wet grassy or marshy areas from tundra to temperate lowlands and hilly regions. NON-BREEDING: wet meadows, flooded fields, bogs, swamps, moorlands, and marshy banks of rivers and lakes. BREEDING: Nests in tussock of vegetation in or at edge of marsh, wet meadow, or bog."
Empidonax minimus,"Freshwater marshes, canals, quiet rivers, lakes, ponds, mangroves, primarily in areas of emergent vegetation and grassy borders; taro patches in Hawaiian Islands. Infrequently flies. Nests usually among marsh plants over water, occasionally in shrub in or near water. Builds nestlike platforms on which to brood young."
Empidonax traillii,"Breeding habitat includes usually clear lakes (McIntyre 1988) containing both shallow and deep water areas (McIntyre 1975, 1988; Strong 1985). In studies comparing lakes with and without loons, higher turbidity was suggested as a factor influencing lack of occupancy (Barr 1973, McIntyre 1988). Nest sites are on small islands(Olson and Marshall 1952, Vermeer 1973, McIntyre 1975, Titus and VanDruff 1981, Strong 1985), quiet backwaters (Strong 1985), or mainland shores. Loons have been found nesting in marshy portions of lakes in water depths no greater than 0.5 m (Alvo 1981). Optimal nest sites, as measured by degree of success, include overhead cover to conceal eggs from predators, protection from wind and waves, good visibility by incubating adults, and a steep slope adjacent to the nest for adequate underwater approaches and exits (McIntyre 1975, 1983, 1988). Brood-rearing areas are typically located in shallow coves of fairly uniform depth, sheltered from prevailing winds and wave action, and are independent of nest site location (McIntyre 1983, Strong 1985). Adults tending chicks prefer shallow water areas (&lt; 2 m) close to land (&lt; 150 m) (Strong 1985, Strong and Bissonette 1989). Deepwater areas (&gt; 4 m) distant from land (&gt; 250 m) are avoided by feeding adults and adults tending chicks, but are often used for social interactions (Strong 1985). Breeding adults usually feed outside of nursery areas (Strong 1985), occasionally outside of their territories (McIntyre 1983), and may visit nearby lakes for feeding (Miller and Dring 1988).<br /><br />In winter and during migration, common loons use inland lakes and rivers and marine and estuarine coastal waters. Most nonbreeding subadults apparently remain in coastal areas during breeding season. Winter primarily in coastal marine habitats, including bays, coves, channels, inlets and other shallow areas (Bent 1919, McIntyre 1988, Palmer 1962). Some individuals overwinter on inland lakes and rivers, although this appears to be largely weather influenced (McIntyre 1988). While shallow, inshore waters appear to be utilized more frequently than deeper, offshore waters (McIntyre 1978, Daub 1989), some use continental shelf waters up to 100 m in depth and 100 km from land (Haney 1990). In the southeastern U.S. (between 29 degrees and 35 degrees North latitude), wintering loons were most common in waters up to 19 m deep but were rare or absent in highly turbid waters five to 15 km from shore. Loon distribution shifted farther offshore during midwinter to avoid increases in these turbid water areas (Haney 1990). Feeding typically occurs in water depths less than five meters, while maintenance activities (e.g., preening and drifting) take place in deeper water (McIntyre 1978, Daub 1989)."
Empidonax virescens,"Ponds and lakes in coastal and alpine tundra, and coastal flats south of tundra (breeding); primarily bays, seacoasts and estuaries, less frequently on lakes and rivers (nonbreeding) (AOU 1983). <br><br>Nests on edges of lakes and ponds (typically small and shallow), usually on ground in shallow scrape or on mound of mud/plant material; or on hummock in shallow water. Nesting ponds average about 0.3-0.4 ha, may lack food source; 1-4 ponds/territory. In the Northwest Territories, most ponds used for nesting were 0.1-1.0 ha in surface area and 0.3-1.0 m deep; emergent vegetation covered an average of 17% of the pond surface area; over half of the ponds had >80% marshy shoreline; 68% of nests were along wet shorelines, 18% were on islands, and 10% were in shallow water offshore; nests tended to be in sites not exposed to wind-driven waves and were an average of 2 m from open water; most nests were platforms built with aquatic vegetative growth from the previous year (Dickson 1994). In the Northwest Territories, nests within 9 km of marine foraging areas had higher reproductive success than did nests farther away (Eberl and Picman 1993)."
Eremophila alpestris,"ALL SEASONS: Coastlines, salt marshes, estuaries, lagoons, plowed fields, and less frequently along rivers, around lakes, and in freshwater marshes (Clapp et al. 1983). <br><br>BREEDING: This is a marsh-nesting tern along the coast of New Jersey (Wilson 1840, Stone 1908). Bent (1921) concluded that it had been driven to nest on barrier beaches because of hunting at sites on inner dunes, saltmarshes, and islands. Nesting sites are presently confined to sandy barrier islands, beaches, sandy shores of saline lagoons and marshes, and artificially-produced dredge spoil islands (Clapp et al. 1983). Regional differences in nest sites occur, with the percentage nesting on spoil islands ranging from 28% in New Jersey to 60-80% in North Carolina and 70-84% in Texas (Clapp et al. 1983). Some nest on rooftops in Louisiana (Wiedenfeld and Swan 2000).<br><br>Nests are generally located close to landmarks, such as plants or pieces of driftwood, and are usually slight depressions with rims of dried straw and/or shell fragments (Harrison 1975, Sears 1978). Some nests are more elaborate piles of accumulated shell fragments, which may serve to provide protection from drifting sands (Sears 1978). The appearance of the nest lining varies greatly between nests and from day to day in the same nest, depending on the individual, the time available for placing the lining, and weather conditions (Sears 1976, 1978). <br><br>NONBREEDING: Gull-billed terns sleep and loaf on dikes, mudflats, and sandspits (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Eudocimus albus,"BREEDING: Humid deciduous forest (Hamel 1992), dense second growth, swamps. Occurs in stands of various ages but is most common in medium-aged forests (Shugart et al. 1978). Prefers forests with a slightly open canopy, dense understory, and well-developed ground cover (Bushman and Therres 1988). Seldom found in conifers. In Virginia, McShea et al. (1995) found that forest type, streams, and the density of deer were significant variables in territory selection, but forest age (within a reasonable span of years) and the presence of a habitat boundary did not contribute significantly. Specifically, warblers selected cove hardwoods and avoided oak/hickory overstory. The avoidance of oak/hickory overstory is surprising, since a nonquantified gestalt impression of distribution at this site would at first suggest they prefer oak/hickory. Areas with streams and low white-tailed deer (ODOCOILEUS VIRGINIANUS) density also were selected. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration, habitats include forest, woodland, scrub, and thickets. In winter, habitat includes the floor of rain forests; also second growth, forest edge, undergrowth (AOU 1983, Bushman and Therres 1988). This species was found in wet forest (most commonly), moist forest (less commonly), and dry forest (rarely) on the Yucatan Peninsula (Lynch 1992); birds were also captured in mid-successional Acahual habitat. From studies in various Latin American countries, Robbins et al. (1992) concluded that wintering birds are ground foragers that require forest. Some birds were found in early successional habitats, but only an occasional bird was captured in pine woods or agricultural habitats. In Belize, found to prefer broadleaved forest edge and interior habitats (Petit et al. 1992)."
Euphagus carolinus,"Shrubbery and bushes of open deciduous woodland and second growth, and shrubby margins of bogs, swamps, and marshes. In migration and winter: thickets, weedy areas, scrub, and woodland undergrowth, mostly in humid regions (AOU 1983). BREEDING: Nests on or near ground in thickets, thorny briers, or similar growth, in fern or weed clumps, grass tussocks, sometimes up to 1 m above ground in thickets (Harrison 1978)."
Euphagus cyanocephalus,"Marshes (especially cattail), thickets near water, bogs, brushy pastures, old fields, and, locally, undergrowth of humid forest. In migration and winter also in brushy and shrubby areas in both moist and arid regions (AOU 1983). <br><br>Nests just above ground or over water, in weeds, reeds, cattails, tules, grass tussocks, brier bushes, and similar situations; often at base of shrub or sapling, sometimes higher in weeds or shrubs up to about 1 m."
Falco columbarius,"Nesting occurs in dense emergent vegetation (sedge, bulrush) in shallow (often slightly alkaline) ponds (Kuyt 1995), freshwater marshes, wet prairies, or along lake margins. Pothole breeding sites in Canada are separated by narrow ridges vegetated by black spruce, tamarack, and willow. The nest is a mound of marsh vegetation rising about 20-50 centimeters above the surrounding water level.<br /><br />Habitat during migration and winter includes marshes, shallow lakes, lagoons, salt flats, grain and stubble fields, and barrier islands (AOU 1983, Matthews and Moseley 1990). Radio-marked migrants roosted primarily in palustrine wetlands, many of which were smaller than 0.5 hectares (Howe 1989). Migration habitat includes mainly sites with good horizontal visibility, water depth of 30 centimeters or less, and minimum wetland size of 0.04 hectares for roosting (Armbruster 1990, which see for further details)."
Falco peregrinus,"Rocky and sandy seacoasts and islands (AOU 1983); river mouths and estuaries, especially where rocks exposed at low tide; mudflats, salt ponds (Stiles and Skutch 1989). <br><br>Nests on the ground in open sites often on high parts of sandy beaches, also among rocks, on islands, on shingle beds, occasionally in saltmarsh (Harrison 1979, Harrison 1978, Shields and Parnell 1990). In marsh habitats, nested on sand in North Carolina, on sand, wrack, or grass in New York and New Jersey (Lauro and Burger 1989)."
Falco peregrinus anatum,"Arid scrub and brush, thornbush, oak-juniper, pine-oak association, chaparral, open woodland, towns, cultivated lands, savanna (Subtropical and Temperate zones) (AOU 1983). Nests on ledge; on branch of tree, shrub, and cactus; and in hole in tree or wall. May use nest of other species (e.g, grosbeak, cliff swallow); also may use bird house, building ledge, hanging plant, etc. Not a competitive threat to native cavity nesting birds in the eastern North America."
Falco peregrinus tundrius,"Open coniferous forest (especially fir and spruce), mixed forest, forest edge, open woodland, second growth, cultivated areas with trees, swamp openings, city parks, suburbs. In migration and winter also in deciduous forest, weedy areas, bird feeders in residential areas. BREEDING: Nests usually high in conifers in the east, in both conifers and deciduous trees in the west (Terres 1980)."
Falco sparverius,"Breeding habitat most commonly includes areas close to (within 4 km) coastal areas, bays, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, or other bodies of water that reflect the general availability of primary food sources including fish, waterfowl, or seabirds (Andrew and Mosher 1982, Green 1985, Campbell et al. 1990). For example, in Saskatchewan lakes, bald eagle density was positively correlated with abundance of large fishes (Dzus and Gerrard 1993).<br><br>Nests usually are in tall trees or on pinnacles or cliffs near water. Tree species used for nesting vary regionally and may include pine, spruce, fir, cottonwood, poplar, willow, sycamore, oak, beech, or others. Ground nesting has been reported on the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, in Canada's Northwest Territories, and in Ohio, Michigan, and Texas. The same nest may be used year after year, or a pair may use alternate nest sites in successive years. See Livingston et al. (1990) for a model of nesting habitat in Maine. See Wood et al. (1989) for characteristics of nesting habitat in Florida (most nests were in live pine trees). In Oregon, most nests were within 1.6 km of water, usually in the largest tree in a stand (Anthony and Isaacs 1989). In Colorado and Wyoming, forest stands containing nest trees varied from old-growth ponderosa pine to narrow strips of riparian vegetation surrounded by rangeland (Kralovec et al. 1992). In Arizona, recent nests were on cliffs or pinnacles, or in large cottonwoods, willows, sycamores, or ponderosa pines, usually within 1 km of a riparian corridor (J. T. Driscoll, in Corman and Wise-Gervais 2005).<br><br>In winter, bald eagles may associate with waterfowl concentrations or congregate in areas with abundant dead fish (Griffin et al. 1982) or other food resources. Wintering areas are commonly associated with open water though in some regions (e.g., Great Basin) some bald eagles use habitats with little or no open water (e.g., montane areas) if upland food resources (e.g. rabbit or deer carrion, livestock afterbirths) are readily available (GBBO 2010). Wintering eagles tend to avoid areas with high levels of nearby human activity (boat traffic, pedestrians) and development (buildings) (Buehler et al. 1991). Bald eagles preferentially roost in conifers or other sheltered sites in winter in some areas; typically they select the larger, more accessible trees (Buehler et al. 1991, 1992). Perching in deciduous and coniferous trees is equally common in other areas (e.g., Bowerman et al. 1993). Communal roost sites used by two or more eagles are common, and some may be used by 100 or more eagles during periods of high use. Winter roost sites vary in their proximity to food resources (up to 33 km) and may be determined to some extent by a preference for a warmer microclimate at these sites. Available data indicate that energy conservation may or may not be an important factor in roost-site selection (Buehler et al. 1991). Communal night roosts often are in trees that are used in successive years."
Falco sparverius paulus,"BREEDING: Well-drained upland deciduous forests with understory patches of mountain laurel or other shrubs, drier portions of stream swamps with an understory of mountain laurel, deciduous woods near streams; almost always associated with hillsides (Gale 1995, Bushman and Therres 1988). Coastal plain habitats in Maryland include well-drained oak and oak-hickory forests, flatland white oak forests along river terraces, and drier islands of nontidal forested wetlands (Stasz 1996). Dense patches of shrubs or saplings may be an important component of territories (Patton and Hanners, unpub. data; Bushman and Therres 1988). Most abundant in mature woods but also may be common in young and medium-aged stands (see Bushman and Therres 1988). Nests on the ground, usually on hillsides, in cryptic nests among dead leaves, usually against roots or stems of shrubs or saplings, in a slight cavity (Harrison 1978), or up against rock outcrops. Nests are constructed of skeletonized leaves and lined with sporophyte stems of hairy cap moss (POLYTRICHUM sp.). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration, occurs in various forest, woodland, scrub, and thicket situations, but specific habitat requirements are not known. In winter, inhabits undergrowth shrub and subcanopy layers of forests. Wunderle and Waide (1993) reported that worm-eating warblers are forest specialists but use a variety of forest types in the Caribbean, including ""montane pine and broadleaf forest, wet limestone and dry forest, and dry scrub and residential habitats in the Bahamas."" On the Caribbean slope of Central America, habitats include scrub and broadleaf and gallery forests (Rappole et al. 1983)."
Fregata magnificens,"Shallow salt or fresh water with soft muddy bottom; grassy marshes, wet savanna, mudflats, shallow ponds, flooded fields, borders of salt ponds and mangrove swamps (Tropical to Temperate zones) (AOU 1983, Raffaele 1983). <br><br>Nests along shallow water of ponds, lakes, swamps, or lagoons. May nest on the ground or in shallow water on a plant tussock."
Fulica americana,"Open situations, less frequently in partly open habitats, frequently near water (AOU 1983). Wintering concentrations often associated with sugar cane fields (Hilty and Brown 1986, Ridgely and Tudor 1989). Nests in barns or other buildings, under bridges, in caves or cliff crevices, usually on vertical surface close to ceiling. Commonly reuses old nests. Usually returns to same nesting area in successive years; yearlings often return to within 30 km or closer to natal site (Turner and Rose 1989, Shields 1984)."
Gallinago delicata,N/A
Gallinula galeata,"Seacoasts, bays, estuaries, lakes, marshes, and rivers. <br><br>Nests on sandy or gravelly beaches and shell banks along coasts or large inland lakes; sometimes with other water birds. Pacific coast populations formerly nested mainly in inland marshes, now mainly on human-created habitats (e.g., salt pond dikes and levees) along coast; nests on dredge-spoil islands in North Carolina and Florida. See Spendelow and Patton (1988) for further details. In northeastern Lake Michigan, tended to use same colony site in successive years unless previous reproductive effort was unsuccessful (Cuthbert 1988)."
Gavia immer,"BREEDING: deciduous or mixed forests with a dense tree canopy and a fairly well-developed deciduous understory, especially where moist (Bertin 1977, Roth 1987, Roth et al. 1996). Bottomlands and other rich hardwood forests are prime habitats. Also frequents pine forests with a deciduous understory and well-wooded residential areas (Hamel et al. 1982). Thickets and early successional woodland generally do not provide suitable habitat (Bertin 1977). Bertin (1977) found wood thrushes to require one or more trees at least 12 m tall, possibly for song perches, whereas Morse (1971) reported nesting in stands of young white pine with a canopy under 9 m in height. Nests usually are placed in a crotch or are saddled on a branch of a shrub, sapling, or large tree, <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter, habitats include forest and woodland of various types from humid lowland to arid or humid montane forest, also scrub and thickets; primarily undisturbed to moderately disturbed wet primary forest; may wander into riparian forest and various stages of second growth (Rappole et al. 1989, Winker et al. 1990). Were recorded exclusively in forest in Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica (Hagan and Johnston 1992). Winker et al. (1990) studied within-forest preferences of birds wintering in southern Veracruz and found that areas with gaps were preferred in this lowland rainforest; areas with heavy ground cover were also favored."
Gavia stellata,"BREEDING: Second growth, shrubby old pastures, thickets, bushy areas, scrub, woodland undergrowth, and fence rows, including low wet places near streams, pond edges, or swamps; thickets with few tall trees; early successional stages of forest regeneration; commonly in sites close to human habitation. Nests in bushes, brier tangles, vines, and low trees, generally in dense vegetation less than 2 m above ground. NON-BREEDING: In winter, establishes territories in young second-growth forest and scrub (Dennis 1958, Thompson and Nolan 1973, Morse 1989)."
Gelochelidon nilotica,"Habitat includes open woodland, deciduous forest edge, riparian woodland, partly open situations with scattered trees, orchards, and groves of shade trees. In migration and winter this oriole also occurs in humid forest edge, second growth, and scrub; treetop level in coffee and cacao plantations, and savanna groves. Nests are placed in trees, an average of around 25-30 feet (8-9 meters) above ground, usually at the end of a drooping branch."
Geothlypis formosa,"Farms, suburbs, shade trees along roads, orchards, open woodlands, scattered trees in cultivated areas, riparian woods in prairie regions; also scrub, second growth, brushy hillsides (AOU 1983). Nest usually suspended at end of branch of tree or shrub, concealed among leaves, commonly 3-6 m above ground."
Geothlypis philadelphia,"BREEDING: Tall forest, open woodland, prairie, semiarid rangeland, shelterbelts, wooded areas bordering lakes and streams in more open regions, scrubby oaks and mesquite, and lowland/floodplain forests. Requires open areas near nesting sites for foraging. More specific breeding habitat components vary by region (Great Plains and Southeastern U.S.). Nests in fork or crotch of tree, high up where possible but sometimes low in scrubby trees (Harrison 1978). May sometimes nest in stands of mature trees in towns. Most nests placed in non-conifer near woodland edge. Often reuses old kite nest. <br><br>Historically, in the Great Plains was associated with areas having sizable riparian woodlands along major river systems. Kite numbers increased during the 1950's and 60's as the birds began using shelterbelts (tree plantings designed for windbreaks and to impede soil erosion) as nest sites (Johnsgard 1990, Meyer 1990, Bolen and Flores 1989, Parker and Ogden 1979). The increase of mesquite thickets, associated with cattle raising and farming, has also offered new nesting areas, as have farm woodlots and shade trees in towns. This increase in nesting habitat has created a more uniform regional distribution of nesting kites in the Great Plains (Parker 1988, Parker and Ogden 1979). <br><br>In contrast, nest site selection in the Southeast has not changed as a result of habitat alteration to the extent that it has in the Midwest (Parker 1988, Parker and Ogden 1979). Nests in the Southeast are most commonly found in mature, undisturbed stands of lowland and floodplain forests and along major rivers and feed over adjacent fields (Hamel et al. 1982, Hamel 1993, Parker 1988). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Little is known of migration and wintering habits (Johnsgard 1990, Parker 1988, Glinski and Ohmart 1983, Parker and Ogden 1979). Because it prefers to forage over open and edge habitats, agricultural expansion and forest removal in Central and South America may increase foraging habitat and prey populations there, as has happened in North America (Parker 1988, Parker and Ogden 1979)."
Geothlypis trichas,"In the northeastern U.S., this species breeds mainly in wetlands along lakes, rivers, and estuaries on the coastal plain. It is generally absent from the Appalachian highlands and mountainous parts of New York and northern New England (Gibbs and Melvin 1992, Poole et al. 2020). Readily uses artificial wetlands. Habitats vary throughout North America, but nesting usually occurs among dense, tall growths of emergent vegetation (particularly cattail (<i>Typha</i> spp.), sedge (<i>Carex</i> spp.), bulrush (<i>Scirpus</i> spp.), and, to a lesser degree, common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>)), interspersed with open water (Weller 1961, Palmer 1962, Kushlan 1973, Swift 1987, Frederick et al. 1990, Budd and Krementz 2010, Bolenbaugh et al. 2011, Rush et al. 2019, Poole et al. 2020, Dinehart et al. 2023). Both fresh and brackish marshes are used (Palmer 1962, Swift 1987, Andrle and Carroll 1988, Gibbs et al. 1992, Poole et al. 2020). The ìhemi-marshî condition of an equal amount of open water and emergent vegetation appears to be ideal (Weller and Spatcher 1965, Webb 2021). It appears to be tolerant of urban landscapes if suitable habitat is available (Sterling 2008, Rahlin et al. 2022). This species is generally not associated with open, sparse, or short vegetative cover or muddy openings (Fredrickson and Reid 1986, Rush et al. 2019).<br/><br/>Occurrences have been particularly associated with cattail, vegetated edges along deep, open waters (Weller 1961), and nutrient-rich microhabitats (Kushlan 1973). Individuals spend nearly all the diurnal period in dense, grass-like vegetation; open habitats such as mats of emergent vegetation are rarely used (Frederick et al. 1990). In Wisconsin, it was restricted to deep-water and shallow-water cattail habitats, apparently avoiding areas of dry cattail, river bulrush (<i>Scirpus fluviatilis</i>), and sedge (Manci and Rusch 1988). Variably-sized wetlands were used in Maine, with dense, tall stands of cattail, which were often associated with relatively stable water regimes at managed impoundments and coves on lakes (Gibbs and Melvin 1990). On moist-soil impoundments in Missouri, it is associated with waters up to 50 cm deep and rank, dense vegetative cover bordering open water (Fredrickson and Reid 1986). The strong association with cattail in northern regions (e.g., Weller 1961, Swift 1987, Manci and Rusch 1988, Gibbs and Melvin 1990) may occur because cattail is the most common tall plant growing in dense stands above deep water in most northern areas (Frederick et al. 1990). In the Florida Everglades, it was observed from airboats at densities (birds/km) of 0.13 in canals, 0.04 in open grasslands, and 0.37 along airboat trails (Frederick et al. 1990). Most individuals were seen in mixed sawgrass (<i>Cladium jamaicense</i>) and cattail (29% of birds), homogeneous sawgrass (23%), and homogeneous cattail (9%), and, within these vegetative associations, were seen twice as frequently in dense than sparse stands (Frederick et al. 1990). Open sloughs, rush prairies, mats of emergent vegetation, and burn areas were used infrequently (Frederick et al. 1990, but see Kushlan 1973). Among six tidal marshes along the Hudson River in New York, presence was related to the extent of tall bulrush-cattail cover and site elevation (i.e., depth of tidal flooding) (Swift 1987). Favored sites had tall, dense vegetation and low-lying, ""wetter"" sites (peak water depths averaged 70 cm), perhaps because nests are usually placed over water or near open water (Weller 1961, Palmer 1962, Kushlan 1973, Aniskowicz 1981). In tidewater areas of Chesapeake Bay, Stewart and Robbins (1958) reported abundance in narrow-leaved cattail (<i>Typha angustifolia</i>) marshes, common in other coarse marsh types and weak-stemmed brackish marsh types, but scarcity in salt marshes. Sites where bitterns were flushed during spring migration in Missouri (n = 61) had a mean water depth of 23 cm, vegetation height of 64 cm, and stem density of 287 stems/m≤, and were dominated by burreed (<i>Sparganium eurycarpum</i>), water smartweed (<i>Polygonum coccineum</i>), and cattail (Reid 1989). In this study, birds shifted habitat use to taller (121 cm), sparser (165 stems/m≤) stands in fall (n = 15 flush sites) (Reid 1989). Feeding platforms (n = 52) occurred over water averaging 29 cm in depth and among stands of emergent vegetation averaging 199 stems/m≤. Nests are typically located 0.15-0.75 m above water near open water (Terres 1980, Harrison 1979, Brewer et al. 1991), in water typically 10-50 cm deep. Overwintering birds occur in brackish and saline swamps and marshes (Palmer 1962, Hancock and Kushlan 1984), but little is known about wintering habitats."
Grus americana,"Habitats include various sorts of coniferous, mixed, and deciduous forest; forest edge; forest clearings; bogs; open woodland; brushy areas adjacent to forest; and burned-over lands. In migration and winter the species occurs in a wide range of openly wooded and brushy and grassy habitats (AOU 1998). Nests are in scrapes on the ground and usually are concealed by logs, rocks, tree roots, leaves, or ground vegetation."
Haematopus palliatus,"BREEDING: Open country with scattered trees and shrubs, savanna, desert scrub (southwestern U.S.), and, occasionally, open woodland; often perches on poles, wires or fenceposts (Tropical to Temperate zones) (AOU 1983). Suitable hunting perches are an important part of the habitat (Yosef and Grubb 1994). <br><br>For nesting, prefers shortgrass pastures in western Canada, Texas (Telfer 1992), and many other areas (Luukkonen 1987, Novak 1989, Gawlik and Bildstein 1990, Bartgis 1992). In Missouri, pasture land surrounded 67% of 60 nests (Kridelbaugh 1982). In New York, occupied nest sites were in pasture areas with less than 20% woody cover (Novak 1989). However, others have found no preference for short-grass areas (e.g., see Chavez-Ramirez et al. 1994). Historically, orchards seemingly were used with some frequency (see Novak 1989). In the upper Midwest, Brooks (1988) found that nestling growth rate, nesting success, and fledgling success were positively correlated with percentage of home range coverage in grassland. In Virginia, pairs nesting in active pastures produced twice as many young as did those in other habitats (Luukkonen 1987). <br><br>Nests in shrubs or small trees (deciduous or coniferous, e.g., in eastern North America, JUNIPERUS VIRGINIANA, CRATAEUnrankable S sp., MACLURA POMIFERA, ROSA MULTIFLORA). In northern latitudes, nest sites include spruce and fir trees (Bent 1950, Brooks 1988). In some areas, vine-covered plants are preferred (Luukkonen 1987, Novak 1989). In Missouri, nests in multiflora rose were less successful than were those in trees, perhaps because the nests in roses were lower and poorly supported (Kridelbaugh 1982). In South Carolina, nests in JUNIPERUS fledged a larger number of young than did nests in other sites (5.0 young per successful nest vs. 4.0) (Gawlik and Bildstein 1990). Nests generally are 1.5-3 m above ground, in a crotch or on top of an old nest. In New York, nests were typically 1.5-2.5 m high in trees 4-5 m tall, and usually they were more than a meter back from the outside of the tree (Novak 1989). In Virginia, average nest height was 2.6 m in trees averaging 6.8 m tall; nest height was higher (mean 5.5 m) in second and third nesting attempts (Luukkonen 1987). Nests often in isolated woody plants but also commonly along fencelines or hedgerows (Brooks 1988, Luukkonen 1987), in an open area in a wooded area or in open country. Tends to nest in areas with several potential suitable nesting trees/shrubs (Brooks 1988). <br><br>Sometimes nests in the same site in successive years, but return rates generally are low; males are most likely to reoccupy previous breeding territories (Kridelbaugh 1982, Luukkonen 1987, Brooks 1988, Bartgis 1989, Haas and Sloane 1989). In Minnesota and Virginia, respectively, 50% and 30% of breeding territories were not occupied the following year; in Virginia, reoccupation was more frequent in active pasture than in pastures allowed to grow tall (Brooks 1988, Luukonen 1987). Causes of variation in rates of territory reoccupancy have been discussed but available evidence is inconclusive and may differ in different areas (cf. Brooks 1988, Luukkonen 1987, Novak 1989, Haas and Sloane 1989). For a particular pair during a single season, nesting attempts after the first one generally are close to the first site (mean 90 m in Virginia) (Luukkonen 1987). Both sexes are involved in nest site selection and nest construction (Kridelbaugh 1982). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: During periods of cold with snow cover, sometimes moves into woodlots (Byrd and Johnston 1991). In winter in Virginia, many move from pastures to shrub and open forest habitats during periods of cold, wet weather (Blumton et al. 1989)."
Haemorhous mexicanus,"NON-BREEDING: Seacoasts, bays, estuaries, lakes, rivers, dumps. BREEDING: along rocky and sandy coasts, on tundra, on islands in larger lakes and rivers, or on sea cliffs. Most colonies are on low, rocky, grassy, or sandy islands with low sparse vegetation, but may nest in wide variety of habitats (see Spendelow and Patton 1988 for details on nesting habitat in several regions)."
Haemorhous purpureus,"Seacoasts, bays, estuaries, rivers, lakes, ponds, irrigated fields and plowed lands, cities, dumps. Nests rocky, sandy, and grassy islets or isolated shores, occasionally on marshy lands, often with other water birds; mainly at inland lakes. Nests usually placed in low vegetation. See Spendelow and Patton (1988) for additional information."
Haliaeetus leucocephalus,"Coastal regions, bays, estuaries, and inland on lakes and rivers (AOU 1983); also garbage dumps, tidal flats, sewer outlets, beaches, and sometimes in plowed fields with other gulls (herring, great black-backed) (Terres 1980). Nests on tundra, along sandy and rocky coasts, and on islands in lakes and larger rivers (AOU 1983)."
Helmitheros vermivorum,"ALL SEASONS: Primarily seacoasts, less commonly on large inland bodies of water (AOU 1983). BREEDING: Nests on ground or on rocks on rocky coasts and islands, occasionally on inland lakes. Along western North Atlantic coast, typically nests on small low islands, either rocky, grassy, or sandy with relatively little tall vegetation. On large islands, may nest on rocky peninsula, among boulders, or in low vegetation back from shore. Uses dredge-spoil islands. Usually nested under IVA FRUTESCENS in New Jersey salt marshes. Will nest with other gulls and cormorants (Spendelow and Patton 1988)."
Himantopus mexicanus,"BREEDING: Salt, brackish, and freshwater marshes, pond borders, wet meadows, and grassy ""swamps."" Cover of vegetation peripheral to marsh may possibly be important in reducing predation on rails flushed from marsh by high tide (Evens and Page 1986). Secretive, but may emerge from cover in early morning. Nests in or along edge of marsh, in area with saturated or shallowly flooded soils and dense vegetation, usually in site hidden in marsh grass or at base of Salicornia; on damp ground, on mat of previous year's dead grasses (Terres 1980), or over very shallow water. High tides may destroy nests (see Evens and Page 1986).<br /><br />In northeastern North America, breed primarily in salt and brackish marshes (Davidson 1992). Before the 1950s, most nests in the Northeast were found in saltmarshes behind coastal barrier islands (Davidson 1992). However, wet meadows and freshwater areas of narrow-leaved cattail (<i>Typha angustifolia</i>) and river bulrush (<i>Scirpus fluviatilis</i>) have also been documented (Griscom 1923, Proctor 1981, Armistead 1990). In salt or brackish marshes, home ranges generally include dense stands of saltmeadow cordgrass (<i>Spartina patens</i>) mixed with saltwater cordgrass (<i>S. alterniflora</i>), big cordgrass (<i>S. cynosuroides</i>), marsh spikegrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>), black needlerush (<i>Juncus roemerianus</i>), black rush (<i>J. gerardi</i>), or Olney's threesquare (<i>Scirpus olneyi</i>) (H. Wierenga, pers. comm., Kerlinger and Wiedner 1990). Also occur in the dryer, upland edges of these marshes where saltmeadow cordgrass mixes with marsh elder (<i>Iva</i> <i>frutescens</i>) and groundsel tree (<i>Baccharis halimifolia</i>) in the saltbush community and with common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) in disturbed areas (Kerlinger and Wiedner 1990).<br /><br />Research in wetlands along the lower Colorado River has revealed that water depth is an important and perhaps key habitat component. Black rails there are found typically where the water depth is less than two to four centimeters (R. Flores, pers. comm.). Other significant habitat factors may include vegetation density, distance to open water, and water regime stability (R. Flores, pers. comm.). Nesting takes place in the highest sections of the marsh, which have mesic to hydric soils and are flooded by only the highest tides (Todd 1977, Andrle and Carroll 1988). The area around the nest also typically includes lower wet areas, such as shallow pools and potholes (Andrle and Carroll 1988; W. Burt, W. R. Eddleman and H. Wierenga, pers. comms.).<br /><br />NON-BREEDING: probably similar to breeding habitat, at least in eastern North America (Eddleman et al. 1994). Sites occupied in winter in San Francisco Bay are lower, smaller, more linear and more fragmented than breeding habitat (Eddleman et al. 1994)."
Hirundo rustica,"Breeding habitat includes various open, shrubby deciduous and mixed woodlands, chaparral, riparian thickets, and aspen groves (especially in Rocky Mountains region) (AOU 1998). Specific vegetation composition varies widely depending on location. Habitats during migration and winter include various wooded habitat edges, especially those with dense undergrowth (AOU 1998). Nests are on the ground or in bushes, up to about 0.6 meters above ground (Harrison 1978)."
Hydrobates castro,"Openings of northern woodland, edges of dense spruce forests, cleared balsam-tamarack bogs, grassy places of open aspen and pines, alder and willow thickets, open deciduous second growth. In migration and winter generally in single species flocks in tops of trees of various woodland types--not typically in continuous mature forest; in winter prefers semi-open, second growth, coffee plantations, gardens (Stiles and Skutch 1989). BREEDING: Nests in hollow of moss in bog, or on higher level ground or hillside, in thickets or in open at base of grass or shrub (Terres 1980)."
Hydroprogne caspia,"Forest-bordered bogs, second growth, open deciduous and coniferous woodland, forest edge and undergrowth, cutover or burned areas; in migration and winter in various woodland, scrub, and thicket habitats. Nests on ground at base of bush, small tree, sapling, or clump of grass, or in hollow in moss."
Hylocichla mustelina,"BREEDING: Seacoasts, bays, estuaries, rarely on large inland bodies of water (AOU 1983). Choice of nest site flexible; in different areas may nest on salt marshes (New Jersey), dunes, beaches, shell and shingle ridges of coast and offshore islands, on ground in tall herbage or weeds, or among bushes (Puerto Rico) (Harrison 1978, Burger and Gochfield 1985). Along the northern Atlantic coast south to Massachusetts, nests usually on rocky islands in areas of dense AMMOPHILA and LATHYRUS or under and around MYRICA bushes. From New York to Virginia, nests almost exclusively on tidal salt marshes on or near mats of dead vegetation in tall grasses just above high-tide line. Farther south on Atlantic and Gulf coasts, nests on mats of SPARTINA or, more often, in drier areas on spoil islands or next to clumps of low vegetation in low swales between dunes. In extreme southern Florida, small colonies nest in interior sections of keys on open marl flats or among low herbaceous plants (Spendelow and Patton 1988). NON-BREEDING: Large flocks rest on salt-pond dikes and sandspits (Costa Rica, Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Icteria virens,"Nests in grassy or mossy tundra and wet meadows, in muskeg. The nest is a shallow hollow in mosses or grasses, lined with grasses, leaves, and twigs. Non-breeding habitat includes mudflats, estuaries, shallow marshes, pools, ponds, flooded fields and sandy beaches (AOU 1983, Jehl Jr. et al. 2020). Prefers shallow salt water with soft muddy bottom, but visits various wetlands during migration (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020)."
Icterus galbula,"Nonbreeding: marshes, shores of ponds and lakes, mudflats and flooded fields, primarily in freshwater situations (AOU 1983). Nests on the ground in tundra and wet meadows, usually in marshes or grassy areas with scattered shrubs and trees near open fresh water."
Icterus spurius,"BREEDING: Rich, damp, deciduous floodplain and swamp forests; requires areas with deep shade from both canopy and understory cover (Meanley 1971, Bushman and Therres 1988). On the coastal plain, occurs in the shadiest parts of the forest, with dense upper canopy, lower canopy and shrubs, and little herbaceous cover. The shrub stratum is often nearly monospecific stands of giant cane (ARUNDINARIA GIGANTEA) in floodplain forest; sweet pepperbush or fetterbush in swamps at the northern end of range such as the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and Pocomoke Swamp in Maryland and Virginia and headwater swamps of the Atlantic Coastal Plain; or scrub palmetto in bottomlands. Graves' (2001) data suggested ""a preference for early successional forest in the current landscape or disturbance gaps in primeval forest."" In the mountains, moist lower slopes of mountain ravines at elevations to 900 m are preferred, and a shrub layer of rhododendron is most common (Bent 1953, Meanley 1971, Hooper and Hamel 1979). Individuals were found primarily in sawtimber and to a lesser extent in pole stands of second-growth cove forests in the Southern Appalachians (Hooper 1978). Although often reported to inhabit canebrakes in the literature, it is clearly not exclusively a cane species; structure of the habitat - both overstory and dense shrub understory canopies characteristic of successional forests - is apparently of primary importance, and a variety of shrubs will do (Graves 2001). <br><br>There are few quantified descriptions of habitat. Graves (2001) found that territories in Great Dismal Swamp were characterized by extensive understory thickets (median of 36,220 small woody stems and cane culms per hectare), frequent greebriar tangles, deep shade at ground level and an abundance of leaf litter overlying moist organic soils. These sites occurred most frequently in relatively well-drained tracts of broad-leaf forest that had suffered extensive canopy damage and windthrow (Graves 2001). Meanley (1971) noted that as of 1968 there were still some sections in the Ocmulgee floodplain forest (near Macon, Georgia) ""where canebrakes, nearly uninterrupted, covered 1-sq mile areas."" He recorded densities of cane poles of about 50,000 per ha, averaging five m high, and some reaching to 10 m. In Monkey John Swamp in South Carolina, Meanley recorded 90% canopy coverage (""density""). The scrub palmetto understory averaged about one m in height, with about 20,000 plants per ha. <br><br>Eddleman et al. (1980) provide another quantified look at habitat characteristics in southern Illinois in the Shawnee National Forest. Some of their conclusions differ from those of Meanley. Eddleman et al. (1980) found that the species composition of overstory varied widely among territories and concluded that it had little effect on habitat selection. However, a substantial majority of the birds in their study nested in soft-mixed hardwoods (25 of 36). While the majority of singing males in their study were in forest with overstory trees over 20 yr old, they were found in habitats ranging from late successional old fields with dense shrubs and surrounded by mature forest, to late successional forest. Figures on the frequency of territories falling in each stage were not given. Meanley (1971) noted a few cases where they were found in what he deemed to be marginal habitat (mostly drier areas). He attributed these cases to areas where the warblers were locally common, and the population ""spilled over"" from optimum to marginal habitats. This is a possible explanation for the discovery of this warbler in unlikely habitat such as late-successional old fields. <br><br>In the Eddleman et al. (1980) study, individuals were never found in habitat with trees less than 7.6 m tall. Canopy coverage was always greater than 55%, and usually greater than 75%. Shrub stems (mostly cane) averaged over 26,000 stems/ha in their study, compared to nearly twice that in a study by Meanley (1966) in Georgia. These Illinois birds were only found in sites where soils were alluvial silts and clays. Male territories were limited to forest tracts at least 350 ha in size, and birds were always found within 200 m of water. <br><br>Eddleman et al. (1980) concluded that younger cane stands are needed, that cane needs openings to regenerate and that logging can be used to create openings to manage canebrake habitat. These conclusions have not been corroborated by follow- up studies. And apparently, no further studies characterizing habitat in other locations have been published. Results of timber cuts in warbler habitat in the Shawnee and South Carolina are described under Management Requirements. <br><br>While most accounts agree that this ground-foraging bird prefers areas with little to no live ground cover, accounts of the midstory of the forest vary. Burger (pers. comm.) reports that they are found in cane stands within forests with good overstory, and no midstory, while Meanley (1971) reported three layers to the forest canopy. Nests in understory canes, shrubs, vine tangles, and similar sites, 0.5-3 m above ground, typically within about 200 m of open water, near the edge of a cane stand rather than in the densest part (see Bushman and Therres 1988). In Missouri, all of 29 territories and 16 nests that were found were in stands of cane (Figg 1993).<br><br>This species can be difficult to locate and breeding may occur sparsely throughout areas of suitable habitat previously thought to be unoccupied (e.g. in Maryland, McCann and Heckscher, pers. obs. 1998).  <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In winter probably occurs in undergrowth of mature forest. It has been suggested that the loss of cane habitat in Cuba has been detrimental to wintering populations (Morse 1989). While this may be true, the birds also occur in upland forest with moderate leaf litter in Peninsula de Zapata, Cuba (Hamel, pers. comm.)."
Ictinia mississippiensis,"Marshes and flooded plains; in migration and when not breeding also on mudflats and beaches (AOU 1983) and open shallow water along shorelines. Post-breeders often in flooded livestock feedlots and alkali wetlands in North Dakota. Sleeps or rests on dikes in salt ponds, mangroves (Costa Rica, Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests on ground in grassy prairies, pastures, and hayfields, near lakes and ponds; coastal marshland at James Bay. Often nests in semi-permanent wetlands, may select ephemeral alkali and temporary ponds when available."
Ixobrychus exilis,"Streams, lakes, swamps, marshes, and estuaries; winters mostly in freshwater but also regularly in estuaries and sheltered bays (AOU 1983). <br><br>Nests usually in tree cavities in forested regions near water, often near fast-flowing streams (AOU 1983), also forest ponds and lakes, flooded forest, riverside swamps. See Zicus (1990) for information on successful use of nest boxes in Minnesota."
Junco hyemalis,"Coniferous and mixed coniferous-deciduous forests; also pine savanna and pine-oak habitat. In migration and winter may also occur in deciduous forest, and more open scrubby areas. <br /><br />Nests in conifers, 1.5-25 m above ground, toward outer end of branch (Terres 1980)."
Lanius ludovicianus,"Large marshes and lakes; when not breeding, in both freshwater and brackish areas and foraging in marsh edges, sloughs and sheltered bays (AOU 1983). Nests in freshwater situations with exposed shorelines; on dry land on islands, near lakes, ponds or sloughs; but often relatively far from water."
Lanius ludovicianus ludovicianus,"Lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes. Prefers freshwater but may be found on any open water during migration and winter. Moderate- to large-sized wetland of a permanent or semipermanent nature, expanses of open water with submersed vegetation, and open undisturbed shorelines are important molting habitats (Ringelman 1990). <br><br>Nests in thick vegetation near freshwater lakes, ponds, or streams, including open brackish or alkaline waters. Nests usually in dry upland site under clump of shrubs or in herbaceous vegetation, average of 300 m from water. Tends to nest near semipermanent wetlands that are relatively resistant to drought (Ringelman 1990). Commonly uses man-made ponds. May nest on island, upland meadow or grassland. Suitable nesting islands should be 0.1-0.5 ha in size, elongate, and separated from mainland by at least 150 m of water that remains 0.9 m deep in nesting season (Ringelman 1990). Successful breeders usually return to nesting area used the previous year (Szymczak and Rexstad 1991). A diversity of wetland types is required for successful reproduction, so that brood-rearing habitat is near nesting habitat; females will move brood up to 1.9 km to brood habitat (Ringelman 1990)."
Lanius ludovicianus migrans,"Primarily along water, both freshwater and marine, including lakes, streams, wooded creeks and rivers, seacoasts, bays, estuaries, and mangroves. Perches in trees, on over hanging branches, posts and utility wires. At night, roosts high in a leafy tree near water (Fry and Fry 1992). In some areas availability of foraging sites may be more limiting than the availability of nest sites. BREEDING: Typically nests in a burrow dug by both sexes in the bank of a creek, river, lake, pond, gravel or sand pit, or embankment of a road or railroad; usually but not always near water. Rarely may nest in sawdust heap or tree hole."
Larus argentatus,"Open woodland, deciduous forest, orchards, woodland/forest edge, swamps, parklands, residential areas in towns, scrub, and riparian woodland in drier regions. Evergreen woodland/ forest little used in northeastern U.S. Roosts in tree hollow, among foliage close to trunk, in rock crevice, old magpie nest, nest box, under eaves, or similar site. <br><br>Nests in natural cavity, old woodpecker hole, or bird box, often 1.5-9 m above ground; sites with opening of about 7-20 cm (Voous and Cameron 1989); in Kentucky avoided deep cavities (more than 60 cm) and shallow cavities, used cavities averaged 31 cm deep. In south-central Iowa, the highest use of nest boxes occurred in riparian sites (Iowa Bird Life, 1990)."
Larus delawarensis,"Open woodland (primarily deciduous, less frequently coniferous), second growth, riverine forest, swamps, parks, orchards, shade trees of towns. <br><br>Nests in hole usually less than 12 m up in live or dead tree, stump, utility pole, wooden building, bird box; may nest in same area or tree in successive years; may reuse hole from previous year, including deserted holes of other species. Starlings often take over completed holes."
Larus fuscus,"Open woodland, especially with beech or oak, open situations with scattered trees, parks, cultivated areas and gardens (AOU 1983). Nests in hole excavated 2-25 meters above ground by both sexes in live tree, dead stub, utility pole, or fencepost. Sometimes uses existing holes in poles or posts. Individuals typically nest in the same tree or cavity in successive years (Ingold 1991)."
Larus marinus,"Mostly coastal waters, less commonly on large inland lakes and rivers when not breeding. Nests near lakes and pools on grassy or bushy tundra and in northern taiga (AOU 1983). Usually nests close to water. The nest is a depression lined with plant material, down and feathers."
Laterallus jamaicensis,"This species occurs in lakes, ponds, and sluggish streams in tundra, taiga, and prairie; in winter, mostly shallow marine littoral areas, bays, and estuaries, less commonly on large lakes (AOS 2019)."
Laterallus jamaicensis jamaicensis,"Nonbreeding: primarily marine littoral areas, less frequently in bays or on freshwater lakes and rivers (AOU 1983). Nests in brushy tundra, in freshwater marsh, or in wooded area near pond, bog, or stream. Nests on the ground in an area protected by vegetative cover. The nest is a depression lined with plant material and down."
Leiothlypis celata,"Forest and open woodland, scrub oak, deciduous or mixed deciduous-coniferous areas, especially in mountainous regions (Subtropical and Temperate zones) (AOU 1983). Also agricultural areas in some regions, which may provide important food resources in winter (e.g., in Massachusetts, Vander Haegen et al. 1989). Roosts in trees at night. Severe winters and/or lack of winter habitat are important limiting factors in many northern areas. In a South Dakota ponderosa pine ecosystem, females with young selected mainly large meadows (Rumble and Anderson 1993). <br><br>Nests normally on the ground, usually in open areas at the edge of woods; rarely nests in trees (Fletcher, 1994, Wilson Bull. 106:562-563). In South Dakota, almost all nests initiated in April were in woodland communities whereas nests started after the first week of May were primarily in grassland communities; selected nest sites with concealing vegetation immediately above the nest; nests were placed in habitats associated with high interspersion; shrubs were strongly selected for as nesting cover in grassland; grassland nest sites had a high degree of visual obstruction immediately around the nest site (Day et al. 1991). Sites with good concealment also were selected in Arkansas (Badyaev 1995)."
Leiothlypis peregrina,"BREEDING: Marshes, wet brushy fields, meadows, lakeshores, stream borders, swamps, pine barrens shrub-sedge bogs; also brackish marshes along mid-Atlantic coast (Greenberg and Droege 1990). Nests in tussock of grass, sedge, or in low bush, commonly over water. NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter also in weedy fields, brush, thickets, scrub, and forest edge (AOU 1998)."
Leiothlypis ruficapilla,"Bogs, wet meadows, riparian thickets, shrubby forest edge, marshes, brushy fields; mostly in northern and montane areas. Also jack pine plain barrens. BREEDING: Nests on ground in area of concealing vegetation; sometimes in low bush."
Leucophaeus atricilla,"Brushy, shrubby, and deep grassy areas along watercourses and seacoasts; marshes (cattail, bulrush, and salt); and, mostly in the northern and eastern portions of range, forest edge, bogs, brushy clearings, thickets, hedgerows, gardens, brushy past. BREEDING: Nests on ground, especially early in season, among clumps of dead grasses, weeds; later often 0.5-10 m up in small conifer, thorny bush, willows, cattails, cordgrass (Terres 1980)."
Limnodromus griseus,"Mostly lakes and rivers; winters primarily on open lakes and rivers and brackish lagoons, rarely in marine coastal situations (AOU 1983). <br><br>Nests usually in tree cavities, also on ground and in nest boxes and cliff crevices; generally near clear waters of lakes and rivers in forested regions and mountainous terrain (AOU 1983, Terres 1980)."
Limnodromus scolopaceus,"BREEDING: Rivers, ponds, lakes, and coastal areas (AOU 1983). Nests along inland waters, generally on ground on small islands with low vegetative cover, and also near seacoast and occasionally on shores of ocean or on coastal islands. NON-BREEDING: winters mainly in estuaries and sheltered bays, less frequently on large inland bodies of water (AOU 1983)."
Limnothlypis swainsonii,"Various open and partly open situations from areas of scattered brush or trees to forest edge and semi-desert (absent in forest interior), especially in scrub, thickets, gardens, towns, and around cultivated areas (AOU 1983). Nests in dense shrubbery, tree branches, vines, cholla, prickly pear, sagebrush, usually 1-3 m above ground, often near houses (Harrison 1979)."
Limosa fedoa,"BREEDING: Inhabits young, medium-aged and mature deciduous and mixed forests (Bushman and Therres 1988, Kricher 1995). Studies of habitat selection have yielded conflicting results which appear to be due to geography, as well as variations in forest type and stand age. In the southern part of its range, this species appears to be most closely associated with relatively closed-canopied forests having low shrub density (Conner et al. 1983, Crawford et al. 1981, Noon et al. 1980, Wilson et al. 1995). In Maine and Michigan, it occupies relatively open forests having high shrub density (Noon et al. 1980). Associated with intermediate canopy closure and dense understory vegetation in American Beech-Yellow Birch-Sugar Maple forests in Vermont (Thompson and Capen 1988). More abundant in mature than successional aspen and oak stands in managed forests of Pennsylvania, where its presence correlates with density of understory trees and tall shrubs (Yahner 1986). <br><br>In aspen forests of Alberta, however, stands with high shrub density were avoided (Westworth and Telfer 1993). Associated with high tree density and high canopy volume (indicative of mid- to late-successional forests) in mixed forests of central Ontario (Clark et al. 1983). In Red Maple (ACER RUBRUM)-Sugar Maple-Paper Birch (BEUnrankable LA PAPYRIFERA)-Yellow Birch forests in Nova Scotia, closed-canopied stands having low shrub density were preferred over open-canopied stands with high shrub density (Freedman et al. 1981). In Northern Red Oak (QUERCUS RUBRA)-Red Maple forest in Massachusetts, relatively open canopied stands with moderate shrub densities were preferred (Chadwick et al. 1986). Typically nests on the ground, often adjacent to a tree, shrub, rock, stump or log, under a shrub or dead branches, or, more rarely, atop stumps (Bent 1953, Kricher 1995). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Uses a wide variety of habitats during the winter, from early successional disturbed areas to mature forests (Kricher 1995). Caribbean habitats utilized include coastal forest, dry interior forest, wet forest, forest edge, pine woods, riparian areas, wetlands, urban habitats that provide plant cover, and some open areas (Arendt 1992). Also inhabits cacao, citrus, mango, shade coffee, and pine plantations in Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Costa Rica (Robbins et al. 1992). In Costa Rica, inhabits both young, second-growth forest and primary forest, as well as parks and gardens having large trees (Blake and Loiselle 1992, Stiles and Skutch 1989). Considered a habitat generalist in western Mexico, even though it showed a preference for undisturbed habitats, particularly forest (Hutto 1992). Prefers primary forest over other habitat types in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico (Greenberg 1992, Lynch 1989) and in Veracruz, Mexico (Rappole et al. 1992). In the Virgin Islands, exhibited a preference for moist forest (90.5% of detections) over other habitat types (Askins et al. 1992)."
Lophodytes cucullatus,"Breeding habitat includes woodland, forest (primarily deciduous), forest edge, city parks, suburban gardens, farms, and ranches. Cowbirds often are associated with forest-field edge habitat and clearings in forests. Feedlots, pastures, and fields with livestock also attract cowbirds, especially in predominately forested areas. In the Sierra Nevada of California, cowbirds feed in horse corrals, meadows with herds of cattle, and at bird feeders in towns, and few cowbirds are found more than 10 km from these food sources (Verner and Ritter 1983). In this same area, the number of cowbirds in meadows decreases as the distance of the meadow from pack stations and horse corrals increases. In migration and winter, cowbirds often occur in open situations, cultivated lands, fields, pastures, and scrub.<br><br>Before European settlement of the eastern U.S., Brown-headed Cowbirds were apparently limited to the open grasslands of the United States, mostly west of the Mississippi River. However, because the cowbirds need suitable perches for searching for nests to parasitize, the species was probably limited in the breeding season to prairie riparian corridors (Mayfield 1965). <br><br>The main reason for cowbird expansion outside of the Great Plains appears to be the fragmentation of once unbroken forest tracts into small pieces of forest interspersed with fields, pastures, roads, and towns (Mayfield 1977b, Kerlinger and Doremus 1981). "
Loxia curvirostra,"Various habitats but prefers open areas (Cruz et al. 1989). Partly open situations with scattered trees, open woodland, cultivated lands, pastures, marshes, and around human habitation (AOU 1983). <br><br>Brood parasite and host generalist; lays eggs in nests of many other bird species. In Puerto Rico (and elsewhere), heavily parasitized species include DENDROICA PETECHIA, VIREO ALTILOQUUS, MYIARCHUS ANTILLARUM, and various icterids, including ICTERUS DOMINICENSIS and AGELAIUS XANTHOMUS (Wiley 1985, Post et al. 1993). See Cavalcanti and Pimentel (1988) for hosts in central Brazil."
Mareca americana,"Coastal waters primarily but sometimes several hundred miles out to sea. Spends first 3 years of life at sea all year. Nests primarily on open ground on flat-topped islands, less frequently on rocky slopes and cliffs along coasts (AOU 1983)."
Mareca strepera,"Chiefly freshwater situations: marshes, swamps, lagoons, ponds, flooded fields; depressions in marshes are important during drought; also occurs in brackish wetlands. Nests mostly in upper parts of cypress trees, mangroves, or dead hardwoods over water or on islands along streams or adjacent to shallow lakes. Feeds in freshwater marshes, swamps, lagoons, ponds, flooded pastures and flooded ditches, depressions in marshes (especially during drought)."
Megaceryle alcyon,"BREEDING: deciduous (mainly), mixed, or pine woodland or somewhat open forest (Hamel et al. 1982, Hamel 1992), parks, orchards, wooded residential areas, areas of scattered trees in cultivated regions, clearings and edges of wooded areas, and swamps. Frequents upper levels of trees. Research on canopy selection and flight length indicates a preference for open canopies where unhampered foraging flights can occur (Via 1979). Preferred perches are tall trees, but may also be found on utility lines and short shrub-like growth in recent clearcuts (Via 1979). Nests in natural cavity or old woodpecker hole in live or dead tree, average of 3-6 m above ground; also in bird box, pipe or similar cavity. Morrison (1988) suggested a preference for nestboxes that are hung from trees as opposed to stationary boxes; the former may be less likely to be used by starlings. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: prefers habitat similar to that used in breeding season (Hamel et al. 1982, Hamel 1992). Found mostly in lowland forest, woodland (AOU 1983), and humid to semiarid forest and edge (Howell and Webb 1995). In Colombia: humid forest borders, shrubby clearings, and second growth, occasionally canopy of undisturbed forest (Hilty and Brown 1986). In migration, found generally in wooded habitats (Howell and Webb 1995)."
Megascops asio,"Lakes, ponds, rivers, lagoons, swamps, coastal bays, marine islands, and seacoasts; usually within sight of land. Nests on the ground or in trees in freshwater situations, and on coastal cliffs (usually high sloping areas with good visibility). See Spendelow and Patton (1988) for further details on nesting sites in different geographic areas."
Melanerpes carolinus,"Nesting takes place in a variety of habitats including short-grass prairie (Saalfeld et al. 2010, Stocking et al. 2010, Gregory et al. 2011, Coates et al. 2019, Duggar and Duggar 2020), steppe (Stocking et al. 2010), shrub-desert rangeland (Hartman and Oring 2009), pasture (Hartman and Oring 2009, Saalfeld et al. 2010), and agriculture (Saalfeld et al. 2010, Stocking et al. 2010, Duggar and Duggar 2020). Regardless of habitat type, vegetation height is generally below 30 cm (Fellows and Jones 2009, Saalfeld et al. 2010, Stocking et al. 2010, Gregory et al. 2011, Coates et al. 2019, Duggar and Duggar 2020). There is a preference for placing nests near conspicuous objects on the landscape, such as cowpies or rocks, which has been documented in other shorebird species (Coates et al. 2019, Coates et al. 2021). Juveniles use grassland, steppe, pasture, and agricultural habitats with slightly higher average vegetation heights (Fellows and Jones 2009, Hartman and Oring 2009, Stocking et al. 2010).<br/><br/>During migration, habitat use includes dry short-grass prairie, alkali lakes, playa lakes, wet coastal pasture, tidal mudflats, salt marsh, and agricultural fields (Sedgwick 2006, Fellows and Jones 2009, Page et al. 2014, Duggar and Duggar 2020, Coates et al. 2021). In the non-breeding range, a wide variety of coastal and inland habitats are used. Mud flats and salt marshes of tidal estuaries are the primary non-breeding habitat (Sedgwick 2006, Fellows and Jones 2009, Page et al. 2014, Duggar and Duggar 2020, Coates et al. 2021). Agricultural fields have become an increasingly utilized habitat in the non-breeding range in California (Page et al. 2014, eBird 2024), Texas, and northern MÈxico (Page et al. 2014, Olalla-Kerstupp et al. 2015b, eBird 2024). Sandy beaches are occasionally used (Duggar and Duggar 2020)."
Melanerpes erythrocephalus,"BREEDING: Nests in sedge-dwarf shrub tundra, sedge-meadow, hummock-bog, moorlands, and heath-tundra. Nests in depression. Often returns to same nesting area in successive years (Skeel 1983). NON-BREEDING: beaches, tidal mudflats, marshes, estuaries, edges of tidal creeks, sandy or rocky shores, flooded fields and pastures (AOU 1983). Roosts on saltpond flats and dikes, or in mangroves (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Melanitta americana,"Marshes, swamps, lakes, lagoons, and mangroves; chiefly coastal. Mostly in large cypress swamps in Louisiana, in mangroves in Florida. Prefers mangroves and gallery forest for roosting (Costa Rica, Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests in trees in wooded situations near water, occasionally in arid scrub on islands; sometimes on ground. Along U.S. Gulf Coast from Alabama to Texas, seems to prefer inland freshwater habitats and riverine swamps for nesting (Spendelow and Patton 1988). Nested 8-23 m up in loblolly pines in Virginia, 20-1100 m from water, primarily in highly populated residential areas (Watts 1989)."
Melanitta deglandi,"Marshes, swamps, wooded streams, mangroves, shores of lakes, ponds, lagoons; salt water, brackish, and freshwater situations. Roosts by day in mangroves or swampy woodland. Eggs are laid in a platform nest in groves of trees near coastal marshes or on marine islands, swamps, marsh vegetation, clumps of grass on dry ground, orchards, and in many other situations. Nests usually with other heron species."
Melanitta perspicillata,Pelagic. Regularly observed following boats (Raffaele 1983). Eggs are laid in burrows or in cavities under rocks on islands and in coastal areas.
Meleagris gallopavo,"NON-BREEDING: Mostly pelagic; often around rocky offshore cays. Rests at sea usually on driftwood or flotsam, sometimes on water (Stiles and Skutch 1989). BREEDING: Nests usually in rocky areas or on coral, occasionally on sand, generally in crevices, on ledges, or partially concealed (e.g., among grass tussocks), usually on steep edge of offshore cay."
Melospiza georgiana,"Breeds in spruce and tamarack bogs, dry ridges, poplar and aspen woods, moist areas with low shrubby growth, thick undergrowth, or sapling thickets. In thickets of low wet woods or wet meadows in migration. (Terres 1980, Harrison 1978). NON-BREEDING: woodland, forest borders, shrubby clearings (Ridgely and Tudor 1989). BREEDING: Nests on ground, in small hollow, on moss mound in bog, or in grasses or weeds, or at base of shrub (Harrison 1978)."
Melospiza lincolnii,"Thickets, dense second growth, scrub, forest, primarily in semiarid regions (e.g., tall chaparral thickets along Rio Grande in southern Texas). Mostly arboreal but frequently comes to ground. Nests in dense bushes and trees 1-6 m above ground (Terres 1980)."
Melospiza melodia,"Marshes, lakes and coastal areas; when not breeding, on sheltered brackish and marine coastal areas as well as lakes and rivers (Temperate Zone) (AOU 1983). Nests on freshwater marshes, sloughs, lakes, and ponds, in areas where open water is bordered by dense aquatic vegetation. Nest is a floating structure of marsh plants hidden by growing plants. Often lays eggs in nests of other waterfowl species. May nest at potholes of less than an acre."
Mergus merganser,"Ospreys occur primarily along rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and seacoasts. They often cross land between bodies of water. They typically build large stick nests on living or dead trees and also use numerous man-made structures such as utility poles, wharf pilings, windmills, microwave towers, chimneys, and channel markers (Henny, in Palmer 1988, Campbell et al. 1990). Nests are usually near or above water.<br><br>"
Mergus serrator,"BREEDING: Moist forest, woodland, and ravines along streams; mature deciduous and mixed floodplain and swamp forests. Prefers areas with moderate to sparse undergrowth (Prosser and Brooks 1998) near rapid-flowing water of hill and mountain streams. Ground dweller. Nests on the ground along stream banks, hidden in the underbrush or among the roots of fallen trees, in crevices or raised sites in tree roots, or in rock walls of ravines over water (Harrison 1978, Bushman and Therres 1988). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter also in riparian woodland, scrub and thickets, generally near running water; avoids extensive openings and still water (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Mimus polyglottos,"BREEDING: Breeds in cool, wooded swamps, ponds and slow-moving rivers; thickets of bogs, and rivers bordered with willow (SALIX) and alder (ALNUS, Godfrey 1986, Peck and James 1987). Regional habitats differ slightly. Throughout Canada and Alaska, nests primarily in spruce (PICEA) bogs, along alder-and willow-bordered rivers; also along lakes, swamps, and wet woodlands (Godfrey 1986). However, on islands off Newfoundland, known to nest in areas without standing water and where understory is less dense than on mainland (Vassollo et al.1982). <br><br>In New York state, breeds in hardwood swamps dominated by Red Maple (ACER RUBRUM) on the Great Lakes Plain, in Eastern Hemlock (TSUGA CANADENSIS)-northern hardwood swamps on the Allegheny Plateau, and in spruce-tamarack (LARIX)-balsam (ABIES) swamp valleys and uplands of the Adirondacks and Tug Hill Plateau (Eaton 1988). In Pennsylvania, found in RHODODENDRON swamps and a variety of wooded wetland types (Gross 1992). In Massachusetts, nests in locally in red maple swamps and white cedar and red maple swamps (Viet and Petersen 1993). In West Virginia, nests along rhododendron-bordered mountain streams, in spruce swamps and northern mixed forest to beech (FAUnrankable S)-maple (ACER) forest (Brooks 1944). <br><br> Where sympatric with Louisiana Waterthrush, nests in areas with more forbs and ferns, with significantly more moss cover, hummocks, and conifers and with a higher density of shrubs; significantly more Eastern Hemlock and alder in Northern Waterthrush territories (Craig 1985). <br><br>NONBREEDING: Found mainly in damp tropical lowland forest, edges of pools and streams, mainly below 1,500 m. Mangroves (RHIZOPHORA, AVICENNIA, LABUNCULARIA) provide key habitat throughout much of range (Stotz et al. 1996, Bond 1971, Wetmore et al. 1984, Binford 1989, Lefebvre et al. 1992, Wunderle and Waide 1993). In Costa Rica, also found in open second growth or at wet spots in trails or roads (Stiles and Skutch 1989 Blake and Loiselle 1992). In northeast Nicaragua, in rain forest adjacent to pine habitat (Howell 1971). Tends to avoid disturbance, but may do well in second-growth tropical forest, edges, or woodlots (Ehrlich, et al. 1988). <br><br>Throughout its winter range found mainly below 1500 m (Curson et al. 1994). Highest recorded elevation in Columbia 3000m (Hilty and Brown 1986). In Costa Rica, ranges from lowlands to 1500 m, rarely higher, on both slopes, often extremely abundant in September along Caribbean coast; most numerous in Caribbean lowland and mangroves along the Pacific coast (Stiles and Skutch 1989). In Belize, most numerous in mangroves and gallery forest (Eaton 1995); occurs sparingly in cropland of cacao, rice, and citrus fruits (Robbins et al. 1992). In the West Indies, most often near the border of standing water, primarily saline and brackish, in or near mangroves and coastal scrub forest (Raffaele et al. 1998). <br><br>MIGRATION: Prefers damp woodlands with standing water, thick cover along streams, in marshes, and by stagnant pools, but is also found on lawns and in hedgerows and thickets (Winkler et al. 1992)."
Mniotilta varia,"North America: cities, villages, farms, parks. Nests in cavities and in crevices of structures."
Molothrus ater,"BREEDING: Prefers habitat with short to intermediate vegetation height, intermediate vegetation density, and a well developed litter layer. These preferred habitats cover a wide range of vegetation types, including alpine and arctic tundra, coastal salt marshes, sedge bogs, grassy meadows, and native prairie (Wheelwright and Rising 1993). <br><br>In North American grasslands, occupies tallgrass prairie, idle and lightly grazed mixed-grass prairie, shortgrass, wet meadow zones surrounding prairie wetlands, alfalfa (MEDICAGO SATIVA)/brome (BROMUS spp.) hayfields, native and tame dense nesting cover (DNC), Conservation Reserve Program lands, weedy crop and stubble fields, retired cropland, and wheat fields (Stewart 1975; Salt and Salt 1976; Renken 1983; Dale 1993; Hartley 1994; Johnson and Igl 1995; Patterson and Best 1996; Prescott and Murphy 1995, 1996). Although occasionally breeds in cropland, is more abundant in idle native, DNC, and Conservation Reserve Program lands (Hartley 1994, Johnson and Igl 1995, Patterson and Best 1996). In Illinois, found in mixed and pure stands of hay, pastures, and idle grasslands, but reached highest densities in pastures and idle grasslands (Graber and Graber 1963). In Wisconsin and Ohio, abundance was positively correlated to percent herbaceous vegetation cover (Sample 1989, Swanson et al. 1997). In North Dakota and Saskatchewan, abundance was positively correlated with percent grass cover (Renken 1983, Renken and Dinsmore 1987, Sutter 1996). However, at a less arid site in Saskatchewan, abundance was negatively correlated to percent grass cover (Sutter 1996). <br><br>Most abundant on Conservation Reserve Program fields with high percent grass and low percent legume cover in the northern Great Plains (Johnson and Schwartz 1993). In Oregon and Nevada, Rotenberry and Wiens (1980) found a positive correlation between abundance and percent forb cover. In Wisconsin, abundance was negatively correlated to maximum vegetation height and vegetation height-density (Sample 1989). Wiens (1969, 1973) stated that low, dense vegetation was required for nest sites; grass-dominated habitats with little forb cover are preferred (Wiens 1969, 1973; Welsh 1975; Knight 1989; Vickery et al. 1992). In Wisconsin, avoided habitats with tall, dense vegetation and nested primarily in managed or disturbed habitats such as pastures and hayfields (Sample 1989). In Michigan, nested in hayfields of clover (MELILOTIS and TRIFOLIUM spp.), alfalfa, brome (BROMUS spp.), and timothy (PHLEUM PRATENSE), and in clumps of grass near cow pies in an overgrazed pasture (George 1952). In Maine, nesting birds in areas of mainly forb and shrub cover experienced lower reproductive success than those nesting in predominantly grass cover (Vickery et al. 1992). In Quebec, vegetation height did not differ between nest sites and random points, but successful nests were surrounded by taller vegetation than unsuccessful nests (Bedard and LaPointe 1984). <br><br>Avoids areas with extensive tree cover (Wheelwright and Rising 1993). Wiens (1969) noted that most breeding territories were located in the center of grassland habitats, away from cultivated fields and fence lines, and Sample (1989) found a negative correlation between abundance and percent shrub cover. In North Dakota, were found only on shrubless transects (Arnold and Higgins 1986). In Wyoming sagebrush steppe, were observed only on burned and herbicide treated areas with fewer shrubs and more grass and forb cover (Kerley and Anderson 1995). In West Virginia, nesting territory often included small trees, shrubs, and fence posts (Shields 1935). In Saskatchewan, nested in or near clumps of sparse western snowberry (SYMPHORICARPOS OCCIDENTALIS) shrubs (Lein 1968). Although total woody cover in habitats used for nesting was low (< 1 percent), Sample (1989) reported that the birds often used small trees and shrubs (< 2 m tall), fence posts and wire, and tall herbaceous stems as song perches. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration, open fields, roadsides, dunes, coastal marshes, edges of ponds, and rarely in open woodlands (Wheelwright and Rising 1993). In winter, cultivated fields, pastures, golf courses, roadsides, dunes, and salt marshes (Wheelwright and Rising 1993)."
Molothrus bonariensis,"Dense thickets in coniferous or mixed woodlands, chaparral, parks, and gardens, wooded bottomlands along rivers and creeks. Requires dense brushy cover during the nesting season. <br><br>May nest on ground or in shrubs and trees. Nest usually at height below 2 m."
Morus bassanus,"Partly open situations with scattered trees, riparian woodland, scrub, thickets, cultivated lands, woodland edges, overgrown fields, hedgerows. Nests in low tree or bush, tangle of vegetation, usually about 1-3 m above ground, often at edge of open area (Harrison 1979)."
Mycteria americana,"In general, few data exist on habitat requirements and they are not well quantified (Lowther et al. 1999). Partly open situations with scattered brush and trees, riparian thickets and brush, weedy and shrubby areas, woodland edges, yards and gardens in the southern U.S. Nests in bush or vine tangle, usually 1-2 meters up; sometimes in tree in thick Spanish moss at greater height (Harrison 1978). Western breeding populations use semi-open country with scattered trees and shrubs, riparian areas, abandoned farmland and other early successional stages (Parmalee 1959, AOU 1998). <br><br>In the Ouachitas of southwestern Arkansas, common in areas with a patchy mixture of open pasture and well-developed fencerows where farms are still small and family-run (J. Neal, pers. comm.). In southwest Missouri, 18 of 19 measured territories included predominantly old field vegetation (82 percent), with the remainder woodland (18 percent). Vegetative characteristics, however, varied widely between territories suggesting that a broad range of conditions are tolerated (Norris 1982, Norris and Elder 1982). <br><br>The southeastern coastal population uses a variety of habitats for breeding (Lanyon and Thompson 1986, Cox 1996, Meyers et al. 1999). While Meyers et al. (1999) found nesting success to be similar in beach shrub-scrub, managed pine-oak forest, and old growth oak forest, some forest-nesting individuals traveled up to 800 meters to feed in grassy or marshy openings, while shrub-scrub birds remained in core areas. Lanyon and Thompson (1986) determined that salt marsh/forest edge territories were preferred over interior forest, and concluded they were of higher quality. <br><br>Territory sizes measured include 1.13 hectares for one in Oklahoma (Parmalee 1959) and an average of 3.15 hectares on the edge of the range in Missouri (range 0.64-6.66 hectares, n = 19; Norris 1982, Norris and Elder 1982). Territories tend to be larger when there are no other territories adjoining (Norris 1982, Norris and Elder 1982), and smaller in high-quality habitat where territories are contiguous (Finke 1979, Lanyon and Thompson 1986). Males tend to return to nesting sites used in previous year (Lanyon and Thompson 1986)."
Myiarchus crinitus,"BREEDING: Deciduous forest edge and clearings, open woodland, second growth, shrubby areas, scrub, cultivated lands, weedy fields, orchards, hedgerows, overgrown fencerows; avoids mature forests. Nests in crotch of saplings, small bushes, weeds, thickets, vine patch, canebrakes, sometimes in trees, to about four meters above ground in dense cover. Most settle and breed more than two kilometers from their natal site; locally hatched birds comprised 1.6% and 13% of the breeding population in areas of 10 and 4 sq km (Payne 1991). Commonly returns to territory used in previous year (Payne and Payne 1993). NON-BREEDING: In migration, open grasslands, bushes, and leafy trees (Payne 1992). In winter, weedy fields, cropland, and orchards; savanna; and low second growth (Payne 1992)."
Nannopterum auritum,Pelagic; does not follow ships closely; nests on oceanic islands in burrows.
Numenius americanus,"Habitat includes rivers, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, bays, and open marshes, sometimes inshore marine habitats. Pelicans rest/roost on islands and peninsulas. Nests usually are on islands or peninsulas (natural or dredge spoils) in brackish or freshwater lakes, or on ephemeral islands in shallower wetlands as in the northern Great Plains or on the Texas coast (knopf and Evans 2004). Eggs are laid on the ground in a slight depression or on a mound of earth and debris 24-36 inches across, 15-20 inches high (Terres 1980), usually on low flat, or gently sloping terrain. Nest sites usually are in open areas but often near vegetation, driftwood, or large rocks (Spendelow and Patton 1988). Habitats used in winter are mainly coastal but also include also inland waters such as the Salton Sea and some rivers with open water (Knopf and Evans 2004). Suitable sand bars and similar sites for roosting or loafing are important components of winter habitat (Knopf and Evans 2004)."
Numenius phaeopus,"Brown pelicans inhabitat mainly coastal waters and rarely are seen inland or far out at sea. They feed mostly in shallow estuarine waters, less often up to 40 miles from shore. They make  extensive use of sand spits, offshore sand bars, and islets for nocturnal roosting and daily loafing, especially nonbreeders and during the non-nesting season. Dry roosting sites are essential.<br><br>Nesting occurs usually on coastal islands, on the ground or in small bushes and trees (Palmer 1962), including the middle or upper parts of steep rocky slopes of small islands in California and Baja California and low-lying islands landward of barrier islands or reefs on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, where nests often are in mangroves, sometimes in Australian ""pines,"" red-cedars, live oaks, redbays, or sea grapes. In the subtropics and tropics, mangrove vegetation constitutes an important roosting and nesting substrate (Collazo and Klaas 1985, Schreiber 1979, Schreiber and Schreiber 1982). Brown pelican may shift among different breeding sites, apparently in response to changing food supply distribution (Anderson and Gress 1983) and/or to erosion/flooding of nesting sites."
Nyctanassa violacea,"Cliff swallows inhabit open to semiwooded habitat, cliffs, canyons, and farm country, generally near meadows, marshes, and water.  They build bottle-shaped mud nest in colonies on cliffs, under eaves of buildings, under bridges, and similar sites sheltered by an overhang. Many return to same nesting area in successive years, but colonies tend to switch nesting sites between seasons, evidently due to a buildup of insect parasites in the nests. Cliff swallow commonly repair and use old nests."
Nycticorax nycticorax,"Habitat specialist. Historically, found in mature to old growth southern pine woodland subject to frequent growing-season fires; a fugitive species, breeding wherever fires created suitable conditions. Requires well-developed grass and herb layer with limited shrub and hardwood midstory components. Ideal habitat was originally the extensive longleaf pine woodlands of the south. Able to colonize recent clearcuts and early seral stages of old field succession but such habitat remains suitable only for a short time. Habitats include dry open pine (southern states) or oak woods (e.g., western portion of range) with an undercover of grasses and shrubs, hillsides with patchy brushy areas, overgrown fields with thickets and brambles, grassy orchards, and large clear-cuts (usually at least 20 ha in Virginia). In the southeastern U.S., Coastal Plain breeding habitat usually is open pine woods with thick cover of grasses or saw palmetto; in the Piedmont, mainly in overgrown fields with scattered saplings, occasionally in open woods with thick grass cover (Hamel 1992). Very occasionally breeds along the edges of wheat or corn fields (Blincoe 1921, Graber and Graber 1963, Mengel 1965).<br/><br/>In South Carolina, higher densities were recorded in mature (more than 80 years old) pine stands than in young stands (Dunning and Watts 1990).<br/><br/>In northwestern Florida, inhabited a longleaf pine stand during the first three years after annual spring fires were discontinued; canopy cover was 43% and ground cover was 85%. Five years after the burns stopped canopy cover increased to 91%, ground cover decreased to 21%, and breeding no longer occurred (Engstrom et al. 1984).<br/><br/>In Missouri, breeding areas include red-cedar groves of limestone glades where woody plants constitute less than 33% of the plant cover (Probasco 1978), early succession shrub and grass old fields, shrub and grass savanna, oak-hickory stands cut within the past three years, and stands of shortleaf pines with diameters of less than 7.6 cm (Evans and Kirkman 1981, Hardin et al. 1982). Within 13 territories in limestone glades, shrubs had an average cover of 4.1% and tree cover averaged 2.3% (Hardin et al. 1982). See also Hardin and Probasco (1983).<br/><br/>In the southern states, singing perches generally are on the dead lower branches or stubs of living pine trees (LeGrand and Schneider 1992).<br/><br/>Winters mainly in habitats with dense grassy cover, mostly under open pine woods, also in grassy fields, such as broomsedge (Hamel 1992), scrub oak, and along fence rows; has been recorded in riparian habitats and sometimes along the saltwater shores of coastal woodlands (Burleigh 1958, Bent 1968, Sprunt and Chamberlain 1970, LeGrand and Schneider 1992). In Florida, wintering Bachmanís sparrows were twice as numerous on areas that had been burned 4-6 months earlier (Cox and Jones 2008).<br/><br/>Nests on the ground in dense cover, against/under grass tuft or under low shrub (Harrison 1978), in grassy opening, field, or area with scattered trees. Open, domed nests are built by the female and consist of coarse dry grasses and weed stems lined with finer materials (Blincoe 1921, Ganier 1921, Brooks 1938). Six nests in Alabama were 18-20 cm high and 11.4 cm wide, with a smaller inner cavity (Weston, in Bent 1968). In Florida, bare ground and lower amounts of grass at nest sites are important ground level conditions that begin to decline within the first six months post fire (Jones et al. 2013). Greater than 85% of nests were located in areas burned the previous growing season. Tucker et al. (2006) found that fewer territorial males remained unpaired and breeding productivity was greater in areas burned within the first three years than in older burns.<br/><br/>Spends a great deal of time walking/running rather than flying, and are therefore inextricably linked to the open groundcover conditions created by frequent fire for foraging as well as nesting (Cox and Jones 2007)."
Oceanites oceanicus,"Pelagic. Nests in crevices or holes, usually on cliffs on small islands."
Onychoprion anaethetus,"Pelagic. Nests on tropical islands in rocky crevices, holes or caves, especially on cliffs, occasionally in trees (AOU 1983); sometimes under grass or shrubbery (Terres 1980). In Puerto Rico, nested in coastal boulder talus an average of 2 m from forest edge, within 6 m of the waterline and 2 m above mean high tide (Schaffner 1991)."
Oporornis agilis,"Nonbreeding: primarily pelagic, occurring in migration on bays and estuaries, rarely on ponds, lakes and marshes; mainly in plankton-rich upwelling zones. May be driven to coast or inland by strong winds. In northern Alaska, postbreeding habitat was mainly gravel coastal beaches (Smith and Connors 1993). Nests on coastal tundra; hummocky moss-sedge tundra interspersed with numerous ponds; wet unpatterned tundra with strangmoor ridges for nesting. Nests on the ground in a depression that is sometimes lined with grasses or other plants. Nest may be hidden by grass that is pulled over the depression."
Ortalis vetula,"In winter: primarily pelagic, sometimes occurring in migration on ponds, lakes, open marshes, estuaries, and bays (AOU 1983), costal lagoons, salinas, sewage ponds. May occur along coast especially during stormy weather. Nests in grass-sedge borders of ponds and lakes (AOU 1983), often far from the sea; wet marshy areas of tundra and in taiga; low arctic and subarctic (coastal and low arctic tundra, northern boreal forest regions). Nest is a depression, lined and domed with grass. See also Rodrigues (1994)."
Oxyura jamaicensis,"BREEDING: Shallow freshwater and saline ponds, marshes and wet meadows (AOU 1998). Nests on the ground in wet meadows, grassy marshes, and along edges of shallow inland waters. The nest is a well-concealed scrape, lined with grass. Uses both fresh and alkali wetlands with three characteristics: open water, emergent vegetation, and open shoreline (Saunders 1914, Hohn 1967, Stewart 1975, Prescott et al. 1995, Naugle 1997). Nesting habitat varies widely, including wetlands, wet meadows, upland grasslands, and road rights-of -way (Bent 1927, Roberts 1932, Hohn 1967, Stewart 1975, Murray 1983, Bomberger 1984, Colwell 1987, Colwell and Oring 1990, Einemann 1991, Faanes and Lingle 1995, Dinsmore and Schuster 1997). Occasionally occur in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields and dense nesting cover (Johnson and Schwartz 1993; Prescott et al. 1993; D.H. Johnson, unpubl. data). <br><br>In North Dakota, densities were highest in undifferentiated tillage wetlands (wetlands with frequently tilled soils), followed by temporary, seasonal, semipermanent, fen, alkali, and permanent wetlands (Kantrud and Stewart 1984). Often occupied the peripheral low prairie and wet-meadow areas of most classes of wetlands in North Dakota. In South Dakota, occurrence was associated positively with the presence of seasonal and semipermanent wetlands, stock ponds, and intermittent streams; area of alfalfa (MEDICAGO SATIVA) hayland; area of surface water; and the percentage of grazed shoreline (Weber 1978, Weber et al. 1982). In eastern South Dakota, the probability of occurrence in semipermanent wetlands was related positively to the proportion of untilled uplands and the number of emergent hydrophyte species (e.g., willow [SALIX spp.]) composing > 10% of the vegetated wetland area; were associated negatively with wetlands dominated by thick-stemmed plants (e.g., cattail [TYPHA spp.] and river bulrush [SCIRPUS FLUVIATILIS]) (Naugle 1997). Within seasonal wetlands, the probability of occurrence was related negatively to wetlands dominated by thick-stemmed plants (Naugle 1997). <br><br>Nest site selection varies seasonally. Nests in upland vegetation early in the breeding season and wet-meadow vegetation later in the season (Colwell and Oring 1990). Usually nests less than 100 meters from shoreline (Hohn 1967, Hatch 1971, Colwell and Oring 1990, Eldridge in prep.). Nest sites in Nebraska were in wet sedge (CAREX) meadows (Faanes and Lingle 1995). In North Dakota and Iowa, nested in wetlands associated with river floodplains (Murray 1983, Koenig 1984). In Alberta, Saskatchewan, and North Dakota nested in grasses of various heights on islands or in wet-meadow zones around lakes and wetlands; in Saskatchewan, brood rearing occurred in patches of foxtail barley (HORDEUM JUBAUnrankable M) (Bent 1927, Hohn 1967, Kagarise 1979, Colwell 1987). In Saskatchewan, Colwell and Oring (1990) found that nest sites had taller, denser, and more homogeneous vegetation and less bare ground than randomly selected sites. However, in the Nebraska sandhills, nest sites had shorter vegetation than random sites (Bomberger 1984). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: on lake shores, mudflats, salt marshes, freshwater marshes, alkaline ponds; rarely along seacoasts; stages on salt lakes (Colwell and Jehl 1994, AOU 1998). Also at sewage ponds; rarely reported at sea."
Pandion haliaetus,"Second-growth woods, mature forest edge, borders of swamps and wooded streams, dense growths of small trees, gardens and parks, old orchards. In migration and winter in various forest, woodland, and scrub habitats; avoids interior of closed forest. Usually remains high in trees but sometimes descends to ground (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests usually in thickets or small trees, generally 2-5 m above ground."
Parkesia motacilla,"Inhabits forest and swamp edges, regenerating clearcuts, open-canopied forests (including deciduous, pine [PINUS], pine-hardwood and spruce-fir [PICEA-ABIES]; particularly those with a well-developed understory), reclaimed strip mines, mid-late successional fields, riparian thickets, overgrown fencerows, shrub/small-tree thickets, and other brushy habitats. Nest is typically constructed on the ground, concealed among dense, woody vegetation. Later nests (renests, second broods) are more likely to be built above the ground (usually to 1.5 m, but up to 5.5 m) than earlier nests (Palmer-Ball 1996, Greenlaw 1996). However, regional differences in nest placement occur. Even early nests are more likely to be above ground in the Southeast than in the Northeast (J. Greenlaw, pers. comm.). Habitat selection does not differ appreciably between the breeding and non-breeding seasons (Greenlaw 1996). Significantly more abundant in open-canopied deciduous forest having relatively dense understory growth than in closed-canopied forest with relatively sparse understory vegetation (Annand and Thompson 1997, Chadwick et al. 1986, Childers et al. 1986, Crawford et al. 1981, DeGraaf et al. 1991, Robinson and Robinson 1999, Yahner 1993)."
Parkesia noveboracensis,"Scarlet tanagers breed in deciduous forest and mature deciduous woodland, including deciduous and mixed swamp and floodplain forests and rich moist upland forests, often where oaks predominate (Bushman and Therres 1988), sometimes in wooded parks, orchards, and large shade trees of suburbs (Isler and Isler 1987, Senesac 1993), less often in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest (Hamel et al. 1982, Hamel 1992). They are most common in areas with a relatively closed canopy, a dense understory with a high diversity of shrubs, and scanty ground cover, and are able to breed successfully in relatively small patches of forest (Bushman and Therres 1988). Breeding occurs in various forest stages but is most frequent in mature woods (according to some sources, prefers pole stands). In New England, nesting occurs mainly in sawtimber hardwoods. Nests are placed in trees (commonly oaks), usually well out on limbs, 2-23 meters above ground. Typical nest site characteristics: 1) the nest is placed in a leaf cluster, or with at least several leaves shading the nest, 2) the nest is placed on a nearly horizontal tree branch, 3) there is a clear unobstructed view of the ground from the nest, and 4) there are flyways from adjacent trees to the nest (Senesac 1993). <br><br>During the northern winter, scarlet tanagers inhabit forest canopies and edges, including tall second growth (Isler and Isler 1987). Migrants may occur in more open habitats, such as woodlands, parks, and gardens, as well as forests (Isler and Isler 1987)."
Passer domesticus,"BREEDING: Deciduous woods (often near gaps and edges) in eastern U.S., stands of oaks, pines, and hickories in Southeast, and willows and cottonwoods at low elevations along streams and in canyons in Southwest (Robinson 1996). Also in parks. Nests in trees, usually well out on horizontal lower branch, 3-11 m above ground (Harrison 1978). NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter in various forest, woodland, and scrub habitats, and in scattered trees in clearings and pastures; in South America, more numerous in mountains than in lowlands (Hilty and Brown 1986, Ridgely and Tudor 1989)."
Passerculus sandwichensis,"BREEDING: Arctic rocky shores, cliffs, stony escarpments and dry tundra (AOU 1983). May venture far out on ice-covered Arctic Ocean (Johnson and Herter 1989). In northwestern British Columbia nests in rocky alpine habitats (Campbell et al. 2001). Nests on ground in bare rocky areas; nest usually well hidden in crevice. May also nest in bird house, cabin, pipeline support, or other structure, or under beach debris. NON-BREEDING:in migration and winter in grassy or weedy fields, stubble, and along roadsides and shores of lakes and oceans (AOU 1983)."
Passerella iliaca,"Marshes, swamps, lagoons, pond margins, lakes, flooded pastures; fresh, brackish, and salt water. Reported as mainly in freshwater habitats on the Atlantic coast of Florida, more common in saltwater habitats in Louisiana (Spendelow and Patton 1988). Nests usually with herons or other water birds, on the ground in a marsh or in small trees or bushes near water (e.g., in BACCHARIS, IVA, and MYRICA along the U.S. Atlantic coast). See Spendelow and Patton (1988) for further details on nesting habitat in different regions."
Passerina caerulea,"Nonbreeding: short grasslands, pastures, golf courses, mudflats, sandy beaches, and flooded fields (AOU 1983). Nests on grassy tundra; prefers dry upland areas. The nest is a shallow scraped-out depression, lined with mosses, leaves, grass, and lichens. In western Alaska, where DOMINICA and FULVA are sympatric, DOMINICA nests occurred more often in areas of higher elevation and slope, with sparser and shorter vegetation, and more rocks; FULVA nests were usually at lower elevations in denser and taller vegetative cover; both forms used relatively dry upland tundra (Connors et al. 1993)."
Passerina ciris,"BREEDING: Preferred nesting habitat is wet tundra adjacent to dry or stony ground; selects nest sites in light-colored moss and lichens (Johnson and Herter 1989). NON-BREEDING: mudflats, beaches, salinas, wet savanna, shores of ponds and lakes, wet meadows, flooded fields; sometimes mangroves or rocky shores (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Passerina cyanea,"Marshes, ponds and lakes, occasionally along sluggish streams (breeding); bays, estuaries and seacoasts, and in migration commonly in inland freshwater habitats, especially lakes and rivers (nonbreeding) (AOU 1983). Nest on small and large lakes and ponds (about 0.1 ha or larger), in calm waters of marshes, along rivers and streams. Favors areas with much open water. Usually nests among tall vegetation in shallow water. Highest breeding densities occur in pothole marshes of aspen woodland."
Pelagodroma marina,"Winters along seacoasts, bays, and estuaries. In migration, found on lakes, ponds, and rivers. Nests mainly on shallow, freshwater lakes (>2 ha.) or shallow protected marsh areas and secluded bays of larger lakes, usually with at least some emergent vegetation and fish populations (Stout and Neuchterlein 1999). Nest is usually in reeds along the margins of shallow lakes; made of dead and rotting reeds and flags, water mosses, etc. raised slightly above the surface of the water, and eggs are generally wet and almost awash (Gabrielson and Lincoln 1959). Sites are chosen for combination of shelter from wind and waves, availability of nest materials and anchorage, easy swimming access, proximity to open water, and distance from shore-bound predators (Stout and Neuchterlein 1999)."
Pelecanus erythrorhynchos,"BREEDING: In eastern U.S., occurs in ponds, sloughs, and marshes, in marshy inlets and along edges of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, and occasionally in estuarine wetlands (Palmer 1962, Chabreck 1963, Cramp et al. 1977, Andrle and Carroll 1988). Nests are typically built in shallow water surrounded by dense vegetation, especially cattail (TYPHA spp.) and bulrush (SCIRPUS spp.), and are farther from shore than from open water (Glover 1953, Stewart 1975, Faaborg 1976, Sealy 1978, Forbes et al. 1989). Wind and waves are major threats to floating nests and surrounding emergent vegetation acts as a wave break, anchors the nest, and conceals the nest from predators (Forbes et al. 1989). Because the direction of wind and waves shifts frequently during the nesting season, sheltered nesting sites can be limiting (Faaborg 1976). In Nova Scotia, avoided nesting on edges of stands of emergent vegetation that were exposed to wave action, and nest-site selection was related to structure but not type of vegetation available (Forbes et al. 1989). In comparison to randomly chosen marsh locations, nests were characterized by greater distance from shore, increased proximity to open water, and deeper water (Forbes et al. 1989). <br><br>Microhabitats at Manitoba wetlands included the densest and tallest stands of emergent vegetation available, particularly those in deeper portions of ponds (Nudds 1982). In Iowa, always associated with dense stands of emergent, littoral vegetation, and avoided wetlands with 100% open water (Faaborg 1976). On moist-soil impoundments in Missouri, habitat use was associated with water > 25 cm deep and vegetative cover characterized as ""open, sparse, or short"" (Fredrickson and Reid 1986). Grebe use was not associated with shallower waters or ""dense"" or ""rank"" emergent vegetative cover (Fredrickson and Reid 1986). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Habitats in winter and migration similar to breeding areas (Cramp 1977), but many shift to more exposed areas on brackish, estuarine waters or sheltered inlets on large lakes, rivers, and salt water (Palmer 1962). Root (1988) noted that the densest overwintering populations occur on wide rivers and large lakes."
Pelecanus occidentalis,"Deciduous woodland, forest clearings and edge, swamps, thickets, second-growth woodland, parks, brushy areas, suburban areas. At night, especially in winter, roosts in cavities if available. Nests in cavity in tree or fence post, and in woodpecker holes and artificial cavities, including artificial snags (Grubb and Bronson 1995, Condor 97:1067-1070). Natural sites with decayed wood usually are excavated by birds themselves. Nests usually about 1-5 m above ground (Harrison 1978). See Mitchell (1988) for specifications for the construction and placement of nest boxes."
Pelecanus occidentalis carolinensis,"Deciduous forest, open woodland, second growth, scrub, brushy areas and chaparral (Tropical to lower Temperate zones) (AOU 1983). Also in open pinyon-juniper woodland, where (in Wyoming) it is associated with rosaceous shrubs and rock outcrops (Pavlacky and Anderson 2001). <br><br>Nests especially where tracts of brush, scrub, or chaparral are intermixed with taller vegetation (e.g., forest edge, riparian corridors). Often breeds near water. Nest is built in branch or fork of tree or shrub, usually 1-25 m above ground, by both adults (Harrison 1978). NON-BREEDING: Wide range of brushy habitats in winter."
Petrochelidon pyrrhonota,"Habitats include plains, prairies, dry shrublands, savannas, weedy pastures, fields, sagebrush, arid scrub, and woodland clearings (AOU 1983). In Iowa, breeding territories were along fencerows between agricultural fields (Rodenhouse and Best 1994). <br /><br />Nests are on the ground, often in a small depression near a clump of grass (Harrison 1978)."
Peucaea aestivalis,"Marshes and borders of ponds, lakes, lagoons, and rivers where floating and tall dense waterside vegetation grows; rice fields; usually avoids open water but may use low perch near water (Hilty and Brown 1986). Nests on ground in tall marsh herbage, among plants growing in water, or on branches of shrubs at water level (Harrison 1978)."
Phaethon aethereus,"Primarily shallow freshwater emergent wetlands (e.g., marshes of cattail, sedge, blue-joint, or bulrush), less frequently in bogs, fens, wet meadows, and flooded fields, sometimes foraging on open mudflats adjacent to marshy habitat. Also occurs locally in swamps, along slough borders, and in mangroves. Can use very small marshes (e.g., 4 nests have been found in a half-acre marsh) (see Brewer et al. 1991). Nonbreeding: also in coastal salt marshes; roosts in cattails or other dense vegetation. In northern wetlands and midle-southern Atlantic coastal wetlands, wild rice provides habitat during migration (Fannucchi et al. 1986). <br><br>Nests about 15 cm above water level in marsh vegetation, often near open water. Nest is anchored to emergent plants or sometimes placed on top of a mound (Cogswell 1977). In Michigan, nests most often were over water 10-15 cm deep (see Brewer et al. 1991)."
Phaethon lepturus,"A wide variety of open and partly open situations, frequently near water or around towns (Subtropical and Temperate zones, in winter also Tropical Zone) (AOU 1983). South America: congregates in roosts in city plazas and parks (Ridgely and Tudor 1989). In west and formerly in east nests in tree cavities, abandoned woodpecker holes (including those in saguaro cacti), crevices in rocks; in east and midwest now nests in bird-houses and gourds put up by humans."
Phalaropus fulicarius,"BREEDING: Mature deciduous floodplain, river, and swamp forests; wet lowland forest. Primary habitats are almost always near standing water; swamps that are somewhat open with scattered dead stumps are preferred. Bottomland forests and extensive willow thickets near lakes or ponds are also quite suitable. Requires dense underbrush along streambanks (Bushman and Therres 1988). Nests in cavity (natural, old woodpecker hole, bird box, etc.), in snag or living tree, often or always near or over water, at average height of 1.5-3 m (range 0.9-9.8 m); male selects territory, nest site, places some material before female's spring arrival. May be limited by the number of available nesting cavities. See Blem and Blem (1994) for information on composition and microclimate of nests in Virginia. This is the only eastern warbler that nests in tree cavities or other crannies (the only other cavity-nesting wood warbler (Parulidae) is Lucy's warbler [VERMIVORA LUCIAE]). Petit and Petit (1988) provided the first record of a prothonotary warbler using an open-cup nest built by another species (red-winged blackbird [AGELAIUS PHOENICEUS]). <br /><br />Hamel et al. (1982) provided details on habitat use and suitability in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The following five vegetation types used by this species in five physiographic provinces (Piedmont, Sandhills, Inner Coastal Plain, Outer Coastal Plain, and Coastline) are listed in order of decreasing suitability: oak-gum-cypress is suitable at the sapling-poletimber successional stage, but optimal at the late successional sawtimber stage; both bay swamp-pocosin and elm-ash-cottonwood are only marginal at the sapling-poletimber stage and suitable at the sawtimber stage; southern mixed mesic hardwoods are only marginal in both the sapling-poletimber and sawtimber stages; and pond-pine pocosin is marginal at the late successional sawtimber stage only. In all cases, shrubs, midstory canopy and dead trees or limbs are used for all activities (foraging, nesting, perching, roosting, and singing), and snags must have a dbh of at least 15 cm. <br /><br />Kahl et al. (1985) described habitat around song perches in Missouri as typically level terrain, with a small number of woody stems (&lt; 2.5 cm dbh; &lt; 2800 per ha, never &gt; 4200), short ground vegetation (&lt; 0.20 m, never &gt; 0.36), and a high canopy (16-40 m, never &lt; 12). Other important features included few dead stems (2.5-9.9 cm dbh; &lt; 200 per ha, never &gt; 250) and an intermediate subcanopy closure (30-80%, never &lt; 10 or &gt; 90). <br /><br />NON-BREEDING: In migration, habitat includes dry woodland, scrub, thickets, and mangroves (AOU 1983). Commonly mist-netted in citrus groves in Belize (Mills 1989). Individuals were mist-netted in second-growth marshes, mangrove scrub, and seasonally flooded low forest in the northeastern coastal region of the Yucatan Peninsula (Ornat and Greenberg 1990). Usually occurs near water and most typically in mangroves in Puerto Rico (Raffaele 1989), though Faaborg and Arendt (1992) reported mist-net captures in dry forest in southwestern Puerto Rico. Records from Colombia include mangroves, freshwater swamps, coastal shrubs, and along the Rio Frio River in the edge of the foothills. The birds usually occur near water, but were also historically noted ""in yellow, acacia-like trees on the border of stump land and dry forest, far from water"" (Bent 1953)."
Phalaropus lobatus,"BREEDING: On Bugio, Madeira, breeds where there is a thick layer of earth covered with grass and ice plant (MESEMBRYANTHEMUM). The soil must be deep enough to accomodate burrow construction (Zino and Zino 1986). FORAGING: Pelagic feeder, often seen by shore-based surveys on the breeding islands, but also far offshore. Recorded off North America in deep Gulf Stream waters (Tove 1997a)."
Phalaropus tricolor,"Pelagic. Warm oceanic waters, generally off the continental shelf (see Collar et al. 1992 for further details). Probably feeds in areas of turbulence and upwellings caused by sea ridges and the continental shelf break (Collar et al. 1992). Eggs are laid in burrows on mountain summits (AOU 1983), in soils or crevices of steep forested mountain cliffs (mostly at 1500-2000 m elevation in Haiti)."
Pheucticus ludovicianus,Pelagic. Eggs are laid in rock crevices and on the ground under dense vegetation on islands (AOU 1983); also in burrows in earth and sand outside North Atlantic region (Palmer 1962).
Pipilo erythrophthalmus,"Pelagic. Eggs are laid in burrows on turfy islands, on cliffs of rocky islands, and occasionally inland in mountainous regions (AOU 1983). Both sexes dig new burrow or refashion old one (Terres 1980)."
Piranga olivacea,"Coastal salt marshes and barrier and sea islands, around ponds and streams (Florida peninsula), farmland, towns and cities. BREEDING: Nests generally near or over water, in willows, cattails, sawgrass, bulrushes; also up to 25 m in trees. See Dunham (1990) for information on nest-site selection in Florida."
Piranga rubra,"BREEDING: Partly open situations with scattered trees, open woodland, forest edge, marsh edges, islands, swamp thickets, coniferous groves, cities, suburbs, farms. <br><br>Nests in deciduous or coniferous trees up to 18 m above ground, also shrubs, roadside plantings, swamp vegetation, natural cavities, marshes. NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter also in open situations, cultivated lands, fields."
Plectrophenax nivalis,N/A
Plegadis falcinellus,"Freshwater marshes, upland-wetland marsh edges, ricefields or similar flooded farmlands, shrub swamps; locally in brackish and coastal salt marshes (AOU 1983, Sibley and Monroe 1990, Meanley 1969). <br /><br />Nest is an elevated platform, often with a canopy and ramp, attached to plants growing in shallow water (0-25 cm) or placed in a tussock or other waterside vegetation (Harrison 1978, Meanley 1969)."
Pluvialis dominica,"Freshwater and occasionally brackish marshes, mostly in cattails, reeds, and deep grasses (AOU 1983), also in or close to other emergent vegetation. Inhabits shallow, freshwater, emergent wetlands of every size and type, from roadside ditches and borders of lakes and streams to large cattail marshes (Brewer et al. 1991). Capable of using very small marshes (e.g., 5 nests have been found in a half-acre marsh) (see Brewer et al. 1991). Interspersion of open water and vegetation is an important habitat component (Brewer et al. 1991). Also occurs in salt marshes during the nonbreeding season (Cogswell 1977). <br><br>Nests in dense marsh vegetation over water, or in rank vegetation next to water; nest usually is less than 30 cm above water level. Often nests in vegetation next to open water. NON-BREEDING: In southern Canada overwinters in ice-free, spring-fed wetlands (Cannings et al. 1987)."
Pluvialis squatarola,"Lowland marshes, mudflats, ponds, alkaline lakes, and estuaries (AOU 1983). At Humboldt Bay, California, wintering birds used intertidal mud flats (mainly for for feeding and resting), a sewage oxidation pond (mainly for feeding and secondarily as a source of fresh water), high elevation mud flats (early high tide roost), and islands in a brackish lake (primary high tide roost); typically roosted on shallow, submerged bars of islands in deep nontidal ponds or less often in shallow water or on exposed mud near the water's edge of tidal mud flats (Evans and Harris 1994). Availability of sewage oxidation pond at Humboldt Bay enhanced habitat; the wintering population increased from 30-35 in 1960 (before pond construction) to 500-800 in the 1980s (after pond construction) (Evans and Harris 1994). In coastal South Carolina, most nonbreeding birds used habitats with water 10-17 cm deep (and relatively stable level) and little or no exposed substrate; among several brackish ponds, salinity was not an important factor in habitat selection (Boettcher et al. 1995). <br><br>Usually nests on open flats or areas with scattered tufts of grass on islands or along lakes (especially alkaline) and marshes. Readily nests on artificial islands (such as those created for waterfowl) in impoundments (Giroux 1985). <br><br>In Northwest Territories, Kuyt and Johns (1992) found two instances of avocet eggs in gull nests."
Podiceps auritus,"Coniferous forest and woodland (especially spruce), in migration and winter also deciduous woodland, scrub and brush (AOU 1983). Nests usually in an evergreen, most often in crown 9-18 m above ground; average about 15 m in northern Minnesota (Terres 1980, Galati 1991)."
Podiceps grisegena,"Habitat includes open and partly open situations, frequently near flowing water (AOU 1983). Nests are in steep sand, dirt, or gravel banks, in burrows dug near the top of the bank, along the edge of inland water, or along the coast, or in gravel pits, road embankments, etc. Both sexes construct the nest burrow. Pairs usually dig a new burrow each year, but sometimes they use old bank swallow burrows or abandoned cavities of the belted kingfisher. Individuals tends to return to same nesting area in successive years, though they may move several kilometers away, especially if nesting was unsuccessful the previous year; yearlings often return to the natal area or nearby (Turner and Rose 1989)."
Podilymbus podiceps,"NON-BREEDING: primarily pelagic, sometimes along seacoasts, bays and estuaries, casually on large inland bodies of water (AOU 1983). <br><br>BREEDING: Nests on ledges of steep cliffs along coasts or on islands, often in association with other seabirds; sometimes on ledges of buildings. Nest is a cup-like structure of seaweeds, mosses, grasses, and mud."
Poecile carolinensis,"Primarily coastal waters, including bays, estuaries, lagoons and mudflats in migration and winter (AOU 1983); also quiet waters of rivers and lakes (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Rest on mudflats, sandbars, beaches. <br><br>Nests primarily near coasts on sandy beaches, shell banks, coastal and estuary islands, on wrack and drift of salt marshes (especially where traditional beach nesting areas have been lost or where Herring gulls have become abundant), along tropical rivers, salt pond levees (southern California), and locally, on gravelly rooftops; also on dredged material sites. Nests usually in association with or near terns. See Spendelow and Patton (1988) for further details."
Polioptila caerulea,"Open woodland, situations with scattered trees, farmlands, and suburbs, usually near water. Nests on cliffs, banks, or in ravines in open and riparian woodland or farmland with scattered trees; under bridges and eaves; in culverts or wells; sometimes in buildings. May renovate old nest, such as that of the barn swallow or phoebe. Formerly, natural sites were used; now nests mainly on human-built structures."
Pooecetes gramineus,"BREEDING: Closely associated with young, second-growth hardwoods and other early-successional habitats that are a result of periodic forest disturbance (Straw et al. 1994). Ideal habitat consists of young forests and abandoned farmland mixed with forested land (Keppie and Whiting 1994). Generally considered an edge species. <br><br>Requires a mix of habitats that vary with activity, time of day, and season. These include forest openings or clearings for singing displays in spring, alder or other young hardwoods on moist soils for feeding and daytime cover, young second-growth hardwoods for nesting, and large fields for night-time roosts (Mendall and Aldous 1943, Andrle and Carroll 1988, Boothe and Parker 2000). Should any of these habitats be lacking, the density or productivity of breeding populations may be affected (Gutzwiller et al. 1982). <br><br>Display areas (singing grounds) for courtship and roosting sites are provided by forest openings, clear-cuts, fields, dirt roads, blueberry fields, new tree plantations, and pastures and abandoned farmland such as hay fields adjacent to feeding cover (Mendall and Aldous 1943, Liscinski 1972, Owen and Morgan 1975, Keppie and Whiting 1994, Krementz and Jackson 1999). Burned areas or farmland reverting to woodlands often provide favorable habitat (Brauning 1992). In early summer, these areas also start being used for nocturnal roosting areas by many (but not all) woodcock (Sheldon 1971, Dunford and Owen 1973, Wishart and Bider 1976, Owen et al. 1977, Sepik et al. 1981, Sepik and Derleth 1993). In Maine, these fields average 1.2 ha, and typically have short, sparse plant cover (Dunford and Owen 1973). Plant species composition of singing grounds varies throughout range (Dwyer et al. 1982b, Sepik et al. 1993). <br><br>In comparison with singing grounds, day (feeding) cover is much less open. Use predominantly second-growth (15-30-year-old) hardwood or mixed woods with shrubs, but also including bottomland hardwoods, upland mixed pine-hardwoods, and mature longleaf pine (PINUS PALUSTRIS) after recent burning (Keppie and Whiting 1994). Dense alder (ALNUS spp.) thickets < 20 yr age are especially important throughout much of range, but young aspen (POPULUS TREMULOIDES) and birch (BEUnrankable LA spp.) provide appropriate mixture in the north-central range (Morgenweck 1977, Rabe 1977, Hudgins et al. 1985, Keppie and Whiting 1994); hawthorn and dogwood also in the Northeast (Keppie and Whiting 1994, Straw et al. 1994). Typical overstory canopy cover in diurnal sites is 53-64% (Dunford and Owen 1973), but this may vary daily, seasonally, and regionally according to shrub density and soil moisture that facilitate foraging (Keppie and Whiting 1994). Shrub cover is typically quite high (75-87%; Morgenweck 1977) and often adjacent to the display area. Moist (loamy) soils are important to maintain abundant earthworms. At dusk, woodcock move from daytime feeding cover to roost at night in fields of at least 1.2 acres. <br><br>Nests in young, open, second-growth deciduous forests with well-drained soils. More abundant in open forest than in denser deciduous sapling or conifer cover (McAuley et al. 1996). Nesting habitat varies geographically, including drier woodland sites, young open woodlands, low shrubby cover, old fields, tall herbage bordering clearings, thickets, scrub oaks or pines, open woodland with dead leaf cover on ground, and flat bottomlands near water. High shrub stem density and presence of edge habitat may be important in nest site selection in some areas (Dwyer and Storm 1982). <br><br>On the western edge of its range, may be dependent on moist, wooded, riverine areas and wet meadows in young woodlands (Keppie and Whiting 1994). In eastern Maine, often nests in birch-aspen-spruce-fir (Mendall and Aldous 1943) and aspen (D. McAuley, U.S. Fish Wildl. Ser. unpubl. Data, in Keppie and Whiting 1994). Central portion of range differs. Found predominantly in hawthorn and crabapple fields in Pennsylvania (Licinsky 1972), shrubby old fields in Missouri and well drained ridge tops in Virginia (Murphy and Thompson 1993). In mid-aged, open growth, mixed pine-hardwood forests on lowland flood plains in Virginia (Roboski and Causey 1981). In the Northeast, rarely use conifer stands, except during drought when they may be critical for survival (Sepik et al. 1981). High use of older forest stands has been documented in some areas (Pace and Wood 1993), especially if there is a dense understory (Sheldon 1967, Rabe 1977). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Non-breeding habitat is similar to breeding habitat but typically includes more man-made habitats (e.g. sewage farms, rice fields), upper reaches of estuaries and occasionally coastal meadows (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and is not limited to early-successional habitats. Unlike on the breeding grounds, mature pine-hardwood and bottomland hardwoods are often preferred (Krementz and Pendleton 1994, Horton and Causey 1979). Winter habitats range from bottomland hardwoods to upland pine stands, young pine plantations, and mature pine-hardwoods, though in some pine habitats the birds tend to focus their activities in lowlands dominated by hardwoods (Roberts 1993); generally occupy moist thickets in daytime, and sometimes shift to more open habitats such as pastures, fields (including agricultural), and young clearcuts at night. In Georgia, use of forested habitats at night was extensive whereas use of fields generally was low, though some fields were heavily used (Krementz et al. 1995). See Dwyer and Storm (1982) and Roberts (1993) for detailed information on habitat characteristics. <br><br>MIGRATORY: Diurnal habitat during migration similar to breeding habitat. Found in moist areas with young hardwoods and shrubs. In spring, restricted to snow-free sites (Keppie and Whiting 1994)."
Porphyrio martinicus,"BREEDING: Typically nests in mid-late successional, closed-canopied deciduous or deciduous-coniferous forests that have deep leaf litter and limited understory (Van Horn and Donovan 1994). Also nests in coniferous forest if deciduous forest is unavailable (Noon et al. 1980). Inhabited forest types include oak (QUERCUS)-hickory (CARYA), oak-pine (PINUS), maple (ACER)-basswood (TILIA), maple-birch (BEUnrankable LA), maple-birch-beech (FAUnrankable S GRANDIFOLIA), hemlock (TSUGA CANADENSIS)-oak, Trembling Aspen (POPULUS TREMULOIDES), and spruce (PICEA)-fir (ABIES) (Askins and Philbrick 1987, Freedman et al. 1981, Titterington et al. 1979, Van Horn and Donovan 1994, Westworth and Telfer 1993). Nests on the ground (Hahn 1937). In studies of regenerating forests following clearcutting, found to be absent from, or in low densities in, young, shrubby, open-canopied stands; whereas they occurred in relative abundance in older, closed-canopied stands (Freedman et al. 1981, Thompson et al. 1992, Titterington et al 1979, Webb et al. 1977, Westworth and Telfer 1993). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In the Caribbean region, utilizes a variety of habitats including coastal dry forest, elfin woodland, forest edge, pine forests, riparian forests, wet forests, wetlands, and urban areas (Arendt 1992). In Costa Rica, inhabits primary and secondary forest (Blake and Loiselle 1992); prefers shady understory of forest with well-developed shrub layer (Stiles and Skutch 1989). In Puerto Rico and surrounding islands, occurs in interior forests as well as mangroves and dry thickets (Raffaele 1989). Considered a forest generalist on the Yucatan Peninsula (Lynch 1989), and captured with equal frequency in primary and secondary forest in Veracruz (Rappole et al. 1992). In the Virgin Islands, inhabits both moist and dry evergreen forest, as well as transition zones between these forest types (Askins et al. 1992). Low numbers inhabit coffee, citrus, cacao, and pine plantations in Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Belize and Costa Rica (Robbins et al. 1992). Captured most frequently in pine savanna in Belize (Petit et al. 1992)."
Porzana carolina,"BREEDING: Breeding habitat varies considerably throughout range, but primarily a riparian species associated with epiphytic growth. Found in open deciduous, coniferous, or mixed forest, woodland, floodplain and swamp forest. Prefers mature forest but also occurs in young deciduous woods (Bushman and Therres 1988). Favors woods with a very dense understory of saplings and shrubs near slow or non-flowing water; canopy may range from poorly developed to mainly closed (see Bushman and Therres 1988). <br><br>Southern populations occupy the canopy or subcanopy of riparian bottomland forest, especially where Spanish moss (TILLANDSIA) is found.. In eastern Texas, prefers floodplain hardwood forest dominated by water oak (QUERCUS NIGRA), willow oak (Q. PHELLOS), swamp chestnut oak (Q. MICHAUXII), and black gum (NYSSA SYLVANTICA) with an understory of dwarf palmetto (SABAL MINOR). Found less abundantly in mixed pine-hardwood forests. In the coastal plain of Georgia, breeds in mature hardwood bottomlands with Spanish moss, but in northern Georgia where Spanish moss is absent, breeds in moist wooded ravines of eastern hemlock (TSUGA CANADENSIS, Moldenhauer and Regelski 1996). <br><br>In northern part of range, prefers tall, mature, coniferous forest with spruce (PICEA), hemlock (TSUGA), true fir (ABIES), White Cedar, and Tamarack in moist bogs and swamps where Old Man's Beard lichen (USNEA spp.) or lace lichen (RAMALINA RETICULATA) is abundant. In Nova Scotia, found in stands of Sugar Maple (ACER SACCHARUM), Red Maple (A. RUBRUM), Paper Birch (BEUnrankable LA PAPYRIFERA), and Yellow Birch (B. ALLEGHANIENSIS) and most abundantly in 40-yr-old stands of trees. Less abundant in both older and younger stands (Morgan and Freedman 1986). Density positively correlated with tree density, basal area, percent canopy cover, and canopy height (Morgan 1984). In northern-central Minnesota, inhabits primarily mature undisturbed mixed forest of predominantly deciduous trees with moderate ground and shrub cover and greater than 75 per cent canopy cover (Collins et al. 1982). In Illinois, numbers positively correlated with the presence of sycamore (PLATANUS OCCIDENTALIS, Graber et al. 1983). Appalachian populations favor wet ravines dominated by hemlocks. Found at edges of spruce forests, spruce-covered islands off the Maine coast (Dunn and Garrett 1997). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: A habitat generalist in winter. Occurs in nearly equal frequencies in most common habitat types available. Tropical lowland evergreen forest, pine-oak forest, gallery forest, and secondary forest up to a maximum elevation of 1500 m (Stotz et al. 1996). In scrub and brushy areas (AOU 1998), woodland edge, and mangroves but also arboreal agriculture, sun coffee, citrus plantations, croplands (Arendt et al. 1992, Robbins et al. 1992) and tall second growth, usually from middle heights to high in the canopy (Lynch et al. 1985). Has exhibited sexual segregation in Quintana Roo, Yucatan, Mexico with more males in taller forest and more females in scrub habitats (Morton et al. 1987) <br><br>In Mexico occupies humid to semiarid forest and edge, plantations, and mangroves. Found singly at mid- to upper-levels (Howell and Webb 1995). In Costa Rica found at woodland edges, in semi-open and tall second growth, usually from middle amid foliage to high in canopy (Stiles and Skutch 1989). In Cuba, occupies forest, where it usually forages in higher branches (Garrido and Kirkconnell 2000). In Jamaica, most common in damper woods; trees with broad, thin leaves (Lack 1976). <br><br>MIGRATION: Uses all kinds of wooded areas on migration including humid lowland forest, second growth, scrub and brushy areas (AOU 1998), but shows a preference for deciduous woods; occasionally found in overgrown fields and hedgerows. (Dunn and Garrett 1997)."
Progne subis,"BREEDING: Understory of deciduous and mixed woodland, second growth, partially cleared forest. In New Hampshire, used shrubs for both nesting and foraging, but nest-site requirements appeared to be most important in determining habitat selection (Steele 1993). Nests in small tree, sapling, or shrub in dense undergrowth (e.g., hobblebush, mountain laurel, rhododendron), within about a meter of the ground. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration in other forest types, open woodland, and scrub. In winter usually in dense forests in mountainous interiors of large islands, also in rich lowland forest (Jamaica, Lack 1976); in mature forest and shrubby second growth in Puerto Rico (Wunderle 1995)."
Protonotaria citrea,"Boreal coniferous forest, occasionally adjoining second growth or deciduous scrub. In migration and winter in various forest, woodland, scrub, and thicket habitats. (AOU 1983). Almost anywhere in fall migration (Stiles and Skutch 1989). NON-BREEDING: forest edge, second growth, and lighter woodlands (Pashley 1989, Stiles and Skutch 1989). BREEDING: Nests usually on horizontal branch of tree, generally 1.5-6 m above ground; sometimes nests in shrub or to 15 m in tree."
Pterodroma feae,"BREEDING: A tentative description of the characteristics of breeding habitat is a structurally mature hardwood forest in a mesic or wetter situation, with a closed canopy. The size of the trees is of primary importance and their species identity secondary. Landscape situation and context has a strong bearing on whether otherwise suitable breeding habitat will actually contain warblers (Hamel 1992). In eastern Ontario, breeding territories were characterized by well-spaced large trees, with high canopies and dense foliage cover at heights between 12-18 meters (Jones and Robertson 2001). Habitat is frequently described as mature deciduous forest, particularly in floodplains or other mesic conditions (Robbins et al. 1992 in Tennessee and Maryland; Kahl et al. 1985 in Missouri). Territories in central and western Tennessee are found in forest stands with numerous large trees. Within the stands, territories are located in the areas with more large trees than is typical for the stand and are absent from the portions with small trees (Hamel 1988, Robbins et al. 1992). Observations of the utilization of forest vegetation found birds in the tree canopy, almost always above the midpoint of the tree, at an average height of 17 m in a 22-m-tall tree. These results somewhat contradict the statements of Morse (1989, citing Anderson and Shugart 1974), that this warbler utilizes habitat components in proportion to their availability. <br /><br />Robbins et al. (1989) found occurrences to be associated with large tracts of mature, semi-open deciduous forest in Maryland and adjacent states. Distribution of breeding birds was positively correlated with the natural log of forest area (P &lt; 0.01) and the square root of tree basal area (P &lt; 0.05), and negatively correlated with the arcsine of percent canopy cover by coniferous trees (P &lt; 0.05). In Missouri, Kahl et al. (1985, cited in Robbins et al. 1992), found that habitat around song perches was most consistently characterized by a large number of live stems &gt; 30 cm dbh (range = 50-150 per ha), and a high (always &gt; 18 m), closed canopy (&gt; 85%, never &lt; 65%). Other important features included an intermediate number of woody stems &lt; 2.5 cm dbh (1,030-2,800 per ha, never &lt; 1,030), and few dead stems 2.5-9.9 cm dbh (always &lt; 175 per ha). <br /><br />In North Carolina, a disjunct population occurs in the old-growth, mature floodplain forest communities of well-drained natural levees within 330 m of the Roanoke River (Lynch 1981, cited in Robbins et al. 1992). The dominant canopy species are sycamore (PLATANUS OCCIDENTALIS), green ash (FRAXINUS PENNSYLVANICA), and sugarberry (CELTIS LAEVIGATA). These communities are characterized by a closed canopy ranging in height from 24-30 m, a distinct shrub layer, and complete ground cover. <br /><br />In the Cumberland Mountains of eastern Tennessee, a dense population occurs at Frozen Head State Natural Area (C.P. Nicholson, pers. comm.). This area's second-growth forest is in advanced growth, with a high, closed canopy of large trees similar to those described above, in mesic cove and slope topography. Forest composition is of a diverse assemblage of hardwood trees. In North Carolina, also found in mature cove hardwood forests on relatively steep slopes with little understory (H. LeGrand, pers. comm.). <br /><br />Placement of the nest has been described differently by various authors. Nests in tall tree, about 4.5-27 m up (typically high in tree), well out on large branch, often [apparently] near forest opening. More information is needed on nest site preferences, especially the relationship (if any) to canopy gaps (Hamel 1992). Previous summaries of breeding habitat from studies in the 1980s indicate that the forest in which the birds breed is one with a closed canopy. Bent (1953) states that ""...the nest is usually placed...over an opening [sic]."" A nest discovered in central Tennessee in 1950 was built in an elm at the edge of an opening beside a farmhouse (K.A. Goodpasture, pers. comm.). Bent (1953) describes a nest site that was five meters out on a limb of a tulip-tree (LIRIODENDRON Unrankable LIPIFERA), and 14.8 m up ""....with no other limb between it and the ground."" Harrison (1984) presents a photograph of breeding habitat which shows a discontinuous canopy edge at a forest road. <br /><br />Several important questions arise from these conflicting indications of nesting habitat. Do cerulean warblers usually nest in continuous, unbroken forest? Do they build their nests in the canopy of the forest where little other vegetation occurs between the nest and the groundcover? Do they typically build their nests in association with canopy gaps in otherwise unbroken forest? Are they indifferent to nest situation, using closed canopy forest, canopy gaps, and the edge between forest and other land uses in proportion to their availability? The literature is insufficiently clear to distinguish these alternatives. Observer bias is certainly possible in reporting nest locations when nest searches were haphazard, as was almost certainly the case in the existing literature. In such a case, nests built in locations that are easy to find would appear with greater relative frequency in the literature than in the field. One further possibility is that current observations may not reflect the preferences of the birds as they existed in the past. Instead, the current situation may be only a remnant of the actual capability of the birds; a remnant produced by the action of limiting factors (Hamel 1992). <br /><br />NON-BREEDING: Concentrated on the eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains in western South America. Elevational range is limited to the lower slopes between 500-1,500 m, in precisely the elevation at which human habitat encroachment is proceeding most rapidly (Skutch, cited in Bent 1953; J. Fitzpatrick and S. Robinson, pers. comms.). The winter habitat is mature deciduous forest, also with large trees, although quantitative measurements are so far lacking. This recent information is different than that quoted by Bent (1953, referring to Taczanowski) that the birds range between 10,000-13,000 ft (3,000-4,000 m) in the Peruvian Andes. Terborgh (1989) associates cerulean warblers with montane forests of middle elevations in the Northern Andes. He further indicates that this warbler does not accept disturbed habitats. In migration, occurs in various forest, woodland, second growth, and scrub habitats; forest canopy, gaps and edges, semi-open areas, usually high in trees (Stiles and Skutch 1989). In winter, occurs in forest and woodland borders on mountain slopes, primarily in tall, primary, evergreen forest (Robbins et al. 1992) (deciduous, according to Hamel 1992)."
Pterodroma hasitata,"BREEDING: nests in understory of deciduous forest, especially along streams and ravine edges, and thickets in riverine forests (AOU 1983). Inhabits both young and mature forests but is most abundant in the latter. A dense shrub layer and scant ground cover are important. In North Carolina, common in mountain ravines with dense growth of mountain laurel (KALMIA LATIFOLIA) and rhododendron (RHODODENDRON spp.) and in bottomland swamps with dense pepperbush (CLETHRA ALNIFOLIA) and giant cane (ARUNDINARIA GIGANTEA) (LeGrand, pers. comm.). Generally favors large tracts of uninterrupted forest, but sometimes nests in forest patches as small as 5 ha, probably where these are close to larger forested areas. Nest placed in sapling or shrub in dense deciduous undergrowth, usually between 0.3 - 1.5 m. Individuals often return to the same area to nest in successive years (males are more likely to do so than females). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: undergrowth of various wooded habitats, scrubby areas, and thickets (AOU 1983). On winter range males occupy more mature forests than do females (Powell and Rappole 1986, Lynch et al. 1985); males use closed canopy forests, females use shrub or field habitats (Morton 1990). Older birds occupy higher quality habitat (Stutchbury 1994)."
Puffinus lherminieri,"Nests in forests or open woodlands. In migration and winter found in open forests, woodlands, savanna, roadsides, pastures, and scrub habitat (incl. mangrove thickets in Puerto Rico). May be seen in parks and gardens. Nests on branches 1-15 m above ground."
Puffinus puffinus,"BREEDING: Brushy second growth, dry scrub, low pine-juniper, mangroves, pine barrens, burned-over areas, sproutlands. Small patches of habitat may be suitable for breeding. Subspecies DISCOLOR primarily inhabits various types of shrubby vegetation: brushy second growth, dry scrub, low pine-juniper, jack pine stands, pine barrens, coastal pine subclimax, christmas tree farms, burned-over or cut-over areas, sproutlands, grassland-forest ecotone, powerline corridors, inner forest of Great Dismal Swamp, corridors in hardwood swamps, revegetating strip-mined lands, overgrown apple orchards, and abandoned fields in the breeding season. Many of these habitats are early successional and are suitable beginning about 5 years after burning or clearing and continuing for about 10-20 years. <br><br>Nests usually in a shrub, sapling, thicket, or fern clump, usually 0.3-3 m above ground, occasionally higher (Harrison 1978). In western Massachusetts powerline corridors, nests were 1-3 m above ground in vegetation clumps (1-10 m in diameter) of scrub oak, alder, or meadowsweet; nest locations had 30-100% cover (Houlihan, pers. comm.). In northern Arkansas, nesting areas included old fields invaded by cedars, locusts, sweetgum, persimmon, and pawpaw (Dechant, pers. comm.). <br><br>The following data are from Breeding Biology Research and Monitoring Database (BBIRD) sites in Arkansas plantations, where nests were mainly in hickory, elm (mostly winged), blackgum, oak, red maple, and vaccinium (D. Barber and T. Martin, unpubl. data). Mean values for nest site characteristics in thinned and young plantations were, respectively, 52 and 66% side cover, 67 and 80% overhead cover, 2.6 and 1.5 m nest height, 3.2 and 2.4 m plant height, 4.1 and 3.5 cm plant dbh, and presence of 8 and 13 small (<2.5 cm) and 70 and 54 large woody stems in a 5-m radius surrounding nests. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter, occurs in various woodland, second growth, brush, and thicket situations. Winter is spent mainly in arid lowland forest or scrub, especially second growth, pine, pastures, brushy fields; mangroves, shade trees, sun coffee, and forest edge also are used (Lack and Lack 1972, Arendt 1992). More common in dry forest of introduced mimosaceous trees at Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge (where insects more abundant and birds had higher fat scores) than in dry forest of native species in Guanica (Baltz, pers. comm.). Across the Caribbean region, shows moderate habitat specialization (Wunderle and Waide 1993). In winter in Puerto Rico, September-March, individuals showed strong site fidelity within and between seasons (nearly 50% returned for a second winter, 40% a third winter)."
Quiscalus major,"Pine forest, sycamore-bald cypress swamp, riparian woodland, floodplain forest, live oak woodland. In migration and winter in various woodland, scrub, brush, and thicket situations, but most often in pine woodland if available (AOU 1983). NON-BREEDING: either in inland pines or coastal palms; often in areas of human habitation; prefers semi-open, old second growth, thinned woodland (Stiles and Skutch 1989). BREEDING: Nests in tree canopy, in clumps of Spanish moss if available, otherwise on horizontal branch, 3-36 m above ground."
Quiscalus quiscula,"BREEDING: Coniferous (primarily balsam fir or hemlock) and mixed forest, open woodland, second growth. In Upper Michigan, breeds in natural, older age (60-167 years old), pole, and sawlog size-class stands on mesic upland sites, with canopy closure averaging 80 percent and basal area of conifer trees about three times greater than that of hardwoods (Doepker et al. 1992). There may be some preference for red spruce over white spruce (Morse 1976). Tall trees are important; birds seldom nest in forests without substantial vegetation over 18 meters (Morse 1971, 1976). Loss of forest canopy in the black spruce-Fraser fir forest on Mount Mitchell, North Carolina, from 1959 to 1985 correlated with warbler disappearance (Adams and Hammond 1991). Nests on horizontal branch of conifer, well out from trunk, in site well concealed by foliage or lichen, 2-24 meters above ground. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration in various forest, woodland, scrub, and thicket habitats (AOU 1983). In winter, forests and woodlands of mountain slopes; forest canopy and edge, semi-open areas, tall second growth (Stiles and Skutch 1989). De La Zerda Lerner and Stauffer (1998) report a preference for dense trees, shrubs, and snags, with use of both large forest fragments and small or linear patches, but not solitary trees in pastures or non-native pine plantations. Birds were observed most commonly in the upper third of tree canopies."
Rallus crepitans,"Nesting habitat consists of nearly homogeneous fire-generated stands of usually 30 hectares or more of dense scrubby jack pine (<i>Pinus banksiana</i>), 1.3-6 meters high (6-22 years old) (also reported as 2-4 meters tall and 8-20 years old) interspersed with many small openings, minimal ground cover, and little or no hardwoods, typically in areas of Grayling sand soils and level or gently rolling topography (Mayfield 1960, Walkinshaw 1983, Mayfield 1992, USFWS 2019, Bocetti et al. 2020). Habitat tends to be suitable only for periods of about 10-15 years. When trees reach 3.5 meters or more in height, with no live needles present below about 1.0 meters, habitat becomes increasingly unfavorable and populations decline (Brewer et al. 1991). Habitat tracts of less than 30 hectares are seldom used for nesting (Mayfield 1993). In Wisconsin, it has been documented nesting in habitat dominated by young red pine (<i>Pinus resinosa</i>) with nesting success rates comparable to the core of its range (Olah et al. 2020, Olah et al. 2022, Van Dyke et al. 2022, Olah et al. 2023). Nests are on the ground, well concealed under arching plants near the bases of pines (Bocetti et al. 2020). In winter, this species occurs mainly in low broadleaf scrub, including transient early successional habitats dominated by <i>Lantana involucrata</i>, generally in habitat patches of 2-3 hectares or larger (Miller and Conroy 1990, Mayfield 1996, Bocetti et al. 2020)."
Rallus elegans,"Hemlocks, low dense thickets of spruce and fir, overgrown clearings, swamp and pond borders where small trees grow, forest edge. In British Columbia, breeds in mature, mixed forests and openings in mixed or coniferous woods where a dense conifer shrub layer has developed (Campbell et al. 2001). In migration and winter also in various open forest, woodland, scrub, and thicket habitats; usually secondary and disturbed woodland (Pashley 1989). BREEDING: Nests on branch among twigs and foliage of conifer, or by trunk, usually 4 m or less above ground."
Rallus limicola,"BREEDING: Bogs, open boreal coniferous forest, partly open situations with scattered trees and heavy undergrowth, usually near water. Nests in open tamarack-spruce bog or on barrens, on ground in hummock of moss or lichens, at base of small spruce, fir, birch, sometimes to 60 cm up in crotch of small conifer (Terres 1980). NON-BREEDING: in migration and winter typically on ground in open areas in various woodland, second growth, and thicket habitats."
Recurvirostra americana,"BREEDING: In new, second-growth thickets of alder (ALNUS spp.) and other deciduous bushes growing in scrubby clearings and brushy areas or along the margins of streams, in orchards, pasturelands, forest edges, cut-over forests, roadsides, in open deciduous woodlands and in powerline corridors (AOU 1983, Askins 2000, Dunn and Garrett 1997, Richardson and Brauning 1995). Becomes most common in deciduous second growth or large forest clearings (Richardson and Brauning 1995). Avoids deep woods. <br><br>Makes extensive use of scrubby patches, particularly those with RUBUS spp. present (Richardson and Brauning 1995). At high elevations, mountain laurel thickets are used (Dunn and Garrett 1997). Both wet and dry habitats used. Usually avoids conifer-dominated habitats and mature deciduous forests; however, populations from Manitoba west to Alberta occur in mature deciduous woodland with an understory of dogwoods and cranberries. Rarely found in urban settings and in areas of intensive agricultural use; has decreased where such development has replace fragmented or brushy habitats (Garret and Dunn 1997, see Robbins 1990, Burleigh 1958). <br><br> In the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan, found almost exclusively in stands of pure aspen (Hobson and Bayne 2000). In north-central Minnesota, found in habitat described as open fields with shrubs (Collins et al. 1982) or open habitat (Collins 1981). In the Appalachian Mountains, inhabits high-altitude stunted oak (QUERCUS) forests (Burleigh 1958). In portions of Appalachian region, found in thickets of young chestnuts, which die before reaching maturity (Richardson and Brauning 1995). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Disturbed areas and clearings within tropical forests, forest borders, second-growth and even shaded gardens and coffee plantations (AOU 1988, Dunn and Garrett 1997, Pashley 1989). Also in moist submontane forest, to an elevation of 1300m (Curson et al. 1994). <br><br>In the Canal Zone of Panama, found in equal densities in old and young forest (Greenberg 1984), but prefers mature and late-second growth. Found in mesic and wet sites during wet and dry season, leaving the scrubby areas in the dry season (Morton 1980). Found in mid- to upper canopy of dense, moist forest, but not in the outer canopy of old forests that have a broader, branching structure (Greenberg 1984). In Costa Rica, also inhabits coffee plantations and riparian vegetation (Stiles and Skutch 1989). In Mexico, occupies, humid to semi-humid evergreen forest and edge, plantations, at mid- to upper levels (Howell and Webb 1995). <br><br>MIGRATION: Migrating birds can be found in a variety of shrubby habitats and in open woodlands, occasionally deep forests (Obserholser 1974, Bohlen 1989, Richardson and Brauning 1995)."
Regulus satrapa,"Habitat includes open scrub, second-growth woodland, thickets, farmlands, and gardens, especially near water; riparian woodlands, especially of willows, are typical habitat in the West. In migration and winter, yellow warblers often occur in open woodland, plantations, brushy areas, and forest edge. Winter habitat in Mexico generally has a clear open understory (Greenberg and Salgado Ortiz 1994). Southern populations occupy mangroves, scrub, and thickets. Nests are placed in upright forks or crotches of bushes (e.g., willow), saplings, or large trees, from less than a meter above ground to high in tall trees.<br><br>See Knopf and Sedgwick (1992) for information on nest-site selection in north-central Colorado, where sites were chosen based primarily on characteristics of the vegetation patch rather than on characteristics of the nest plant itself."
Riparia riparia,"Strongly associated with presence of pine and pine-hardwood forest during the breeding and winter seasons. A common breeder in most pine forests of the southeastern United States and in areas with pines in southeast Canada and the northeastern United States, but usually at lower densities, less common as a breeder in white pine forest areas. The highest numbers seem to occur where pure stands of pine are found; less abundant as the proportion of hardwood tree species increases. Birds are rarely found in deciduous forest, scrub, and thickets, except during migration and winter. <br><br>Breeding occurs in a wide variety of pine forest types but not in other conifer forests (e.g., spruce (PICEA spp.), fir (ABIES spp.), larch (LARIX spp.), or hemlock (TSUGA spp.). In the north-central and northeastern U.S. and Canadian provinces, breeding occurs in stands of red (PINUS RESINOSA), pitch (P. RIGIDA), jack (P. BANKSIANA) and white (P. STROBUS) pines (white pine also being used in the Appalachians). In southern states, breeding and winter habitat consists of stands of shortleaf (P. ECHINATA), longleaf (P. PALUSTRIS), loblolly (P. TAEDA), Virginia (P. VIRGINIANA), and slash (P. ELLIOTTII) pines. Breeding occurs less frequently in sand (P. CLAUSA) (Stevenson and Anderson 1994) and pond pines (P. SEROTINA) (Schroeder 1985) in the southeastern U.S. All forest types used may be mixed with varying proportions of hardwood species. Nesting may occur in areas of primarily deciduous forest where small groves of pines are present. Adapts well to pine plantations, which are used for breeding throughout the range. In Florida, Repenning and Labisky (1985) did not record breeding warblers in 1-, 10-, and 24-year-old slash pine plantations, but recorded 8 birds per sq km in 40-year-old plantation forests. However, they found that the species did use 1-year-old (3 birds per sq km), 24-year-old (20 birds per sq km), and 40-year-old (86 birds per sq km) pine plantations during winter. <br><br>In winter, birds commonly forage in large mixed-species flocks in southern pine forests when numbers increase because of birds migrating from farther north. At that time, flocks may forage in forest leaf litter, or in fields and pastures, usually in the vicinity of forest edge. <br><br>Density of pine warblers is inversely related to percent of deciduous vegetation within a stand (Schroeder 1985). In a breeding habitat suitability model developed by Schroeder (1985), three main habitat variables of importance were identified: percent tree canopy closure (excluding white, sand, and pond pines), successional stage of the stand, and percent of dominant canopy pines with deciduous understory in the upper one-third layer. Optimal nesting habitat was provided by pure, dense, mature pine stands (excluding pine species mentioned above) that lack a tall deciduous understory. One shortcoming of this model, however, is that warblers do use white pine forest types for nesting; they simply tend to be less common in those pine habitats. <br><br>Conner et al. (1983) reported that mature pine forests were favored in east Texas, with increasing abundance as the proportion of pole-size pines and vegetation height increased. Tree and shrub species diversity, and foliage density at different heights had little effect. In addition, stands of sapling-sized pines were avoided. <br><br>In eastern Tennessee, Anderson and Shugart (1974) found that distribution was influenced by several habitat variables, the strongest of which was related to average size of understory vegetation, number of canopy trees, and average size of canopy vegetation. In this area, birds selected areas with sparse understory and a dense canopy. In the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, Wilson et al. (1995) found significantly higher densities in forests with a more open midstory, lower canopy coverage, lower basal area of conifers and hardwoods, and dense ground cover of grasses, shrubs, vines, and forbs. <br><br>Nesting occurs typically in pine trees in forest, rarely in deciduous trees within pine forest. Nests usually are placed on a horizontal branch or among foliage at a branch tip, usually 8-20 m above ground. Nests are usually well hidden and difficult to observe from the ground."
Rissa tridactyla,"BREEDING: Various mature and second-growth wooded habitats. Deciduous and mixed deciduous-coniferous second-growth forests, alder swamps, old growth forests with regenerating trees (e.g., around tree-fall gaps), willow thickets, small groves; low, damp, second-growth deciduous and mixed floodplain forests and river swamps; most abundant in mature deciduous forest stands, but also may occur in young woods less than 15 years old; requires closed canopy and prefers dense midstory and understory and well-developed undergrowth; use of pole-stage stands apparently varies geographically (Cruickshank 1979, Crawford et al. 1981, Harrison 1984, DeGraaf 1985, Bushman and Therres 1988, Sherry and Holmes 1997). Nests usually are placed in an upright fork of a deciduous understory sapling, shrub, or tree, occasionally in a vine tangle or old vireo nest; nest usually is about 1-6 m above ground, sometimes as high as 28 m. <br><br>Southeastern U.S.: Primary breeding habitats in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain are bottomland hardwoods and swamps, especially in extensive stands. In the mountains this species occurs in hardwoods along streams, usually where it is open and not heavily wooded. Birds are less frequent in medium-growth hardwood forests away from water. Hamel et al. (1982) described the key habitat requirements for breeding as hardwood forests near water. They provided the following details on habitat use and suitability in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The following five vegetation types used by this species in five physiographic provinces (Mountains, Sandhills, Piedmont, Inner Coastal Plain, and Outer Coastal Plain) are considered in order of suitability: elm-ash-cottonwood is suitable at the sapling-poletimber stage, optimal at the late-successional sawtimber stage; southern mixed mesic hardwoods and oak-gum-cypress are suitable at both the sapling-poletimber stage and sawtimber stage; oak-hickory and cove-hardwoods are marginal habitat at the sapling-poletimber stage and suitable at the sawtimber stage. In all cases, shrubs and midstory are used for all activities (feeding/foraging, nesting, perching, roosting, and singing), whereas the overstory is used for feeding/foraging, perching, roosting, and singing, but not nesting. No specific vegetation sizes were given. Yellow birch is significantly preferred for nesting, and fledging success is significantly higher in yellow birch than beech or sugar maple; this result is especially true for large, old trees. Nest concealment from predators accounts for these patterns (Crew and Sherry, unpubl. data). <br><br>Northeastern and north-central U.S.: In New York, breeders use low, damp woods and have been found in mixed woodland with a considerable growth of pine and hemlock; in the Adirondacks, nest sites often occur where spruces predominate. In Ohio, Michigan, and other sections of the Midwest, this species inhabits the maple, elm, ash, and pine-oak association of the larger, more mature swamp forests, although it is sometimes found among similar trees and brush in the larger upland woods. In the far Northwest, it shows a decided preference for willow trees and alder thickets. In Maine, the bird is found in hardwood or mixed deciduous and coniferous woodlands; these may be low, damp situations but birds are also often found in the second-growth of trees and brush of the dry sandy plains. Alder and willow thickets bordering streams and ponds are used here also (Bent 1953). In New Hampshire, redstarts are especially abundant in second-growth edge and in old-age northern hardwood forests, but they also occur in other moist woodlands, mixed hardwood-conifer woods, and alder and willow thickets. Here, this species breeds from near sea level to above 3000 ft (910 m), where the highest elevation hardwoods grade into conifers in the White Mountains (Sherry and Holmes 1994). <br><br>Quantitative habitat measures have been documented in a few studies. Sabo (1980) measured habitat selection in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and listed the following parameters: mean elevation - 830 m, canopy height - 10.4 m, canopy coverage - 74%, conifer foliage volume - 38%, conifer foliage cover (0-2 m) - 20%, broad leaf foliage volume (>5 m) - 92%, and dbh of live trees - 11 cm. Collins et al. (1982) quantified habitat in north-central Minnesota: ground cover - 67.7%, shrub cover - 70.7%, canopy cover - 66.3%, canopy height - 14.5 m, conifers - 4.7%, and numbers of species of trees per 0.04 ha circle - 4. In addition, Collins et al. (1982) surveyed vegetation and recorded the numbers of trees in different size classes: 10.7 (7.5-15 cm), 10.7 (15.1-23 cm), 8.2 (23.1-30 cm), 4.6 (30.1-38 cm), 1.1 (38.1-53 cm), 0.3 (53.1-68 cm), and 0.1 (>68.1 cm). Sherry and Holmes (1985, unpubl. data) documented significant preferences for deciduous stands of trees along a deciduous-coniferous gradient. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In winter and migration, habitats include various kinds of forests, woodlands, scrublands, and thickets, including mangroves; uses a wide variety of agricultural habitats (e.g., cacao, citrus, pine plantations, mango, and sun and shade coffee plots) (Robbins et al. 1992). Primary wintering habitats are mainly in broadleaf evergreen woods and thickets, such as hammocks and mangroves (Hamel et al. 1982). In Venezuela, mangroves were a transitory habitat, used primarily in the middle of the wintering period by a low number of females (Lefebvre et al. 1992). In Jamaica, widespread in various habitats and are regularly found in drought-deciduous dry limestone forest, citrus, wet limestone forest (evergreen), gardens, and residential areas (Holmes et al. 1989, Holmes and Sherry 1992); they tend to be most abundant at lower elevations (Sherry, pers. comm.). Redstarts in Jamaica segregated by sex, with males in mangroves and females mainly in contiguous scrub habitat (Parrish and Sherry 1994). In the Dominican Republic, habitats include strand vegetation, mangroves, scrub, disturbed dry forest, riparian, urban, disturbed wet forest, mesic forest, and wet forest (Arendt 1992). In the Yucatan Peninsula, redstarts prefer moist forest, but also inhabit dry forest, wet forest, field and pasture, and acahual; late-successional forest stages are clearly preferred (Lynch 1992); redstarts were the third most common species found in mature semi-evergreen forest (after hooded [WILSONIA CITRINA] and magnolia warblers [DENDROICA MAGNOLIA]); were also found in mid-successional Acahual although less commonly so, and were rarely found in field/pasture habitat (Lynch 1989)."
Rynchops niger,"Cool, wet boreal coniferous forest (primarily spruce), usually dominated by low trees; locally also mixed second growth, regenerating burns, peatlands, and alder thickets (AOU 1998). In migration in various forest, forest border, woodland, scrub, and brushy habitats (AOU 1983), clearings with scattered trees. In winter, mostly (exclusively?) on islands in and vegetation surrounding major rivers. <br><br>Nests usually are well hidden in small trees, to about 3 m above ground. Adults usually return to previously used breeding sites (Eliason 1986)."
Sayornis phoebe,"BREEDING: Primarily in forests of spruce (PICEA spp.) and/or fir (ABIES spp.), typically in stands > 50 years old, > 15 m tall, with well developed crowns and some trees that rise above canopy for use as singing posts (AOU 1998, Rosenberg and Hodgeman 2000, Baltz and Latta 1998, Baker 1978, Welsh 1987, Semenchuk 1992). Trees may be scattered or dense; also found near forest edge, especially if birches or hemlocks are present and more open land with small trees (DeGraaf and Rappole 1995). Proliferates in areas heavily infested by spruce-budworms, and may not occur after the outbreak has subsided (Brewster 1938, Erskine 1977, Morse 1989). <br><br>In Ontario found in habitats dominated by White (P. GLAUCA) or Black Spruce (P. MARIANA) of at least 30 m height with Balsam Fir (ABIES BALSAMEA) in canopy and an understory of Speckled Alder (ALNUS INCANA), Labrador Tea (LEDUM GROENLANDICUM), and briers (Kendeigh 1947). In Quebec, occurs in White Spruce plantations at least 50 years old with a sparse shrub understory; average distance between trees 2.4 m +/- 1.3 SD and canopy height > 10 m (DesGranges 1980). In Alberta, uses dense, mature White Spruce, stand of coniferous and mixed forest (Semenchuck 1992). <br><br>In Michigan, found in wet coniferous bogs dominated by black spruce (Baker 1978, L.C. Binford in Brewer et al. 1991). In New York, occupies stands of medium aged spruce (25-75 years old), with some Balsam Fir (J. M. C. Peterson in Andrle and Carroll 1988). In Maine, uses various coniferous forest stands, including second-growth Balsam Fir and Red Spruce (P. RUBENS) with an open understory (Morse 1978). <br><br>MIGRATION: In a variety of forest woodlands (conifers and especially spruces are preferred), scrub and thicket (Godfrey 1986, AOU 1983, Dunn and Garrett 1997). In spring found in association with exotic flowering trees such as silk-oats and bottlebrush as well as flower and catkins of hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, and honey locusts. Fall migrants commonly in berry producing shrubs and small vineyards within woodlands. In Indiana, found in such habitats on campuses, golf courses, tree nurseries, pine plantations and residential areas, in brier patches, overgrown fence rows and weedy roadsides (Mumford and Keller 1984, Baltz and Latta 1988). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Overwinter in mature tropical forests, open woodland and exotic shade and flowering trees (e.g., palm, eucalyptus, casuarinas) over a wide range of elevation. Commonly found in gardens or shade coffee plantations, where flowering plants are abundant. Includes towns, ornamental gardens, parklands, montane forest, arid mesquite, pines, mangroves and other flowering trees, and occasionally dense forest (AOU 1983, AOU 1988, Ehrlich, Dobkin, and Wheye, 1988, Dunn and Garrett 1997, Pashley 1989). Nectar sources (flowering plants) are an important winter habitat component. <br><br>Variety of habitats in the West Indies; shade coffee plantations, coastal thickets and almost anywhere plants are flowering, but uncommon in native dry forest (Raffaele et al. 1998). In the Bahamas, common in gardens and plantings, second-growth, and Red Mangrove (RHIZOPHORA MANGLE); rarely in pine forest (Baltz 1993). In Jamaica, primarily in gardens and parklands to 1,500 m (Lack and Lack 1972). In Puerto Rico and Cuba, common in dry coastal vegetation, more commonly in BUCIDA BUCERAS, BURSERA SIMARUBA, and COCCOLOBA DIVERSIFOLIA (Post 1978, Wallace et al. 1996), and secondary forest (Stacier 1992, Baltz and Latta 1998). <br><br>In the Dominican Republic, occurs in pine and broadleaf, dry scrub, pasture and shade-coffee plantations (Arendt 1992, Wunderle and Waide 1993). Common in Cuba where it is found in forests and gardens (Garrido and Kirkconnell 2000). In Mexico, found in semiarid scrub and woodland and gardens at flowering trees (Howell and Webb 1995). In Costa Rica, in open groves, garden trees, open areas, associating with flowering EUCALYPUnrankable S and ERYTHRINA trees (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Scolopax minor,"Breeds in coniferous, mixed coniferous-deciduous, and entirely deciduous forests (Parrish 1995, Condor 97:935-943), including forest edge, second growth, hemlock forest, cedar-grown pastures, larch bogs, and swamps. In migration and winter, occurs in various open forest, woodland, scrub, second growth, and thicket habitats (AOU 1983); prefers forest canopy and edges, pasture trees, and semi-open, sometimes in low scrubby second growth (Stiles and Skutch 1989). <br><br>Nests often in conifers but also in hardwoods, shrubs, and vine tangles, from almost ground level to about 25 m up (usually low) (Harrison 1978)."
Seiurus aurocapilla,"Habitat includes forest edge, open woodland, and partly open situations with scattered trees, from coniferous or deciduous forest to riparian woodland, also pine woodland or savanna in the tropics. Nests are in natural cavities, old woodpecker holes, bird boxes, or similar sites, mostly 3-20 feet (1-6 meters) above ground."
Setophaga americana,"Coniferous and mixed forest, aspen woodland; in migration and winter also in deciduous forest, open woodland, parks, scrub, and riparian woodland (AOU 1983). Nests usually in excavated cavity in tree stub or branch of dead tree, or dead top of live tree, also in abandoned woodpecker hole, natural cavity, or bird box; average of 4-5 m above ground."
Setophaga caerulescens,"Most frequent in open woodlands of mature trees (primarily oak or pine); pinyon-juniper, clearings, forest edge, parks, and partly open situations with scattered trees (AOU 1983). Nests in natural tree cavity, old woodpecker hole, bird house, usually about 5-15 m above ground."
Setophaga castanea,"Considered endemic to the southeastern pine ecosystem (Bent 1948, Norris 1958, Jackson 1988). Longleaf pine forest on southeastern coastal plain is primary habitat; other pine forests less important (D. McNair, pers. comm.). Forages in pine forests, open pine woods, and pine-oak woodland; less frequently in deciduous scrub, along fence rows, and in open situations with scattered trees. Occasionally in cypress swamp. Nests in cavity in dead wood, especially longleaf pine; requires soft wood for primary excavation (Bent 1948, Norris 1958); may frequently enlarge an existing cavity, occasionally reuse an old one, or infrequently use bird boxes. Can use snags as nest-sites that are not located in forests greater than 35 years old (McNair 1984)."
Setophaga cerulea,"BREEDING: Shallow, often muddy, fresh-water areas with surrounding cover. Ponds, marshes, sloughs, and creeks. Nests near shallow freshwater lake, pond, marsh, etc. Nests on the ground, usually near edge of water. The nest is a hollow lined with plant material and down. NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter in both freshwater and brackish habitats, and in cultivated fields (not typical) (AOU 1983)."
Setophaga citrina,"Marshes, ponds, sloughs, lakes, and sluggish streams. In migration and when not breeding, in both freshwater and brackish situations (AOU 1983); prefers freshwater marshes, ponds, and sloughs, but occurs also in river pools, salt ponds, coastal lagoons, estuaries, and flooded pastures (Costa Rica, Stiles and Skutch 1989; Gammonley and Fredrickson 1995). Commonly colonizes newly available habitats. <br><br>Optimal nesting habitats include semi-permanent wetlands, ponds, and seasonal wetlands surrounded by grassland (Brewer et al. 1991). Nests usually on the ground among tall grasses or sedges, usually near water; seems to prefer to nest in native grass comunities in good range condition (Gammonley and Fredrickson 1995). Nest cover is provided by matted residual herbaceous vegetation (Gammonley and Fredrickson 1995). In the Midwest, bluegrass is the preferred nesting cover; also commonly uses hayfields and sedge meadows within 100 m of water (Brewer et al. 1991). Broods often use semi-permanent wetlands that include about 50% open water and a good supply of aquatic insects and other invertebrates (Brewer et al. 1991). Stock ponds with well-developed emergent vegetation provide locally important brood habitat (Gammonley and Fredrickson 1995). Females change breeding sites from year to year in response to changes in wetland condtitions (Gammonley and Fredrickson 1995). Male breeding territories include one or two small ponds within the home range (Gammonley and Fredrickson 1995)."
Setophaga coronata,"Deciduous or mixed deciduous-coniferous forest; in migration and winter also in a variety of forest and open woodland habitats, parks, orchards (AOU 1983). Nest hole is bored by both sexes; usually located 3-14 m above ground. Generally excavates a new hole each year. See Mitchell (1988) for specifications for the construction and placement of nest boxes."
Setophaga discolor,"Habitats include various forests and woodlands, parks, and gardens and yards in suburban areas. In migration and winter, this species occurs in a variety of woodland and forest habitats, partly open situations with scattered trees, open fields, pastures, and savanna (AOU 1983). It has been positively affected by forest fragmentation in southern Wyoming (Keller and Anderson 1992). Nests often are placed about half way up a conifer or deciduous tree and are hidden among outer branches."
Setophaga dominica,"American goldfinches are associated with weedy fields, cultivated lands, open deciduous and riparian woodland, forest edge, second growth, shrubbery, orchards, and farmlands (AOU 1998). Nests usually are in small trees or bushes, 0.3-10 meters above ground, sometimes in thistles near the ground ( Terres 1980). See Watt and Dimberio (1990) for information on the structure of successful nests."
Setophaga fusca,"BREEDING: Grassland, meadows, savanna, cultivated lands, brushy fields (AOU 1998). Nests on ground in grass or rank herbage, or raised a little above ground, in grass tufts or tall weeds, or in low shrubs or trees, up to about 2 meters above ground but usually low (Harrison 1978). Prefer habitat with dense, moderate to tall vegetation (particularly with some forbs) and moderately deep litter (Gross 1921, 1968; Harmeson 1972, 1974; Wiens 1973; Harrison 1974; Petersen 1978; Rotenberry and Wiens 1980; Roth 1980; Finck 1983, 1984; Skinner et al. 1984; Kahl et al. 1985; Frawley 1989; Sample 1989; Delisle and Savidge 1997; Winter 1998). Suitable habitats are found in oldfields, hayfields, fencerows, hedgerows, road rights-of-way, planted cover (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program [CRP] fields and dense nesting cover), and moderately grazed and idle prairie (Gross 1921, 1968; Taber 1947; Sauer 1953; Ely 1957; Hergenrader 1962; Graber and Graber 1963; Meanley 1963; Emlen and Wiens 1965; Blankespoor 1970; Berry 1971; Harmeson 1972, 1974; Harrison 1974; Stewart 1975; Sealy 1976; Petersen 1978; Rotenberry and Wiens 1980; Roth 1980; Faanes 1981; Finck 1983, 1984; Renken 1983; Skinner et al. 1984; Kahl et al. 1985; Basore et al. 1986; Sample 1989; Camp and Best 1993; Johnson and Schwartz 1993; Steigman 1993; Faanes and Lingle 1995; Johnson and Igl 1995; King and Savidge 1995; Hull et al. 1996; Best et al. 1997; Delisle and Savidge 1997; Winter 1998; W. E. Jensen, Emporia State University, Emporia, Kansas, pers.comm.). A high abundance of forbs provides perches, nesting cover, nest support, and possibly increased invertebrate abundance (Blankespoor 1970; Zimmerman 1971; Harmeson 1972, 1974; Birkenholz 1973; Skinner et al. 1984; Frawley and Best 1991; Klute 1994; Patterson 1994; Patterson and Best 1996; Winter 1998). <br><br>In southwestern Missouri, Skinner et al. (1984) found Dickcissels in medium to tall grasslands with many tall forbs, conditions that were found in moderately grazed to idle cover. Skinner (1974, 1975) reported that densities in northwestern Missouri were highest with moderate amounts of forbs, and were lower when forbs were either very scarce or very abundant. In southwestern Missouri tallgrass prairie fragments, density increased with vegetation height (Winter 1998). In Kansas, densities were higher in oldfields compared with prairie (Petersen 1978; Finck 1983, 1984). Fence posts, small trees, and tall forbs are commonly used as song perches (Laubach 1984, Kahl et al. 1985). <br><br>Nests are elevated in grasses, forbs, shrubs, or trees, and less commonly on the ground in thick vegetation (Gross 1921; Overmire 1962, 1963; Meanley 1963; Zimmerman 1966; Blankespoor 1970; Fretwell 1977; Frawley 1989; Winter 1998). Nest heights range from 0 to 2 meters (Taber 1947, Ely 1957, Meanley 1963, Von Steen 1965, Gross 1968, Berry 1971, Roth 1980, Laubach 1984, Winter 1998). In Kansas, the majority of nests were in forbs (Zimmerman 1966, Blankespoor 1970), followed by isolated American elm (ULMUS AMERICANA) saplings, thistle (CIRSIUM SP.), and grass (Blankespoor 1970). In tallgrass pasture in Kansas, most nests were adjacent to patches of dogwood (CORNUS) (Fleischer 1986). In Oklahoma, nested on the ground and in greenbrier (SMILAX BONA-NOX) thickets within oldfields; nest heights in an oldfield ranged from 3 to 60 centimeters (Ely 1957, Berry 1971). Ground nests were more successful than elevated nests in Oklahoma; as the season progressed, however, nests were built higher above the ground (Overmire 1963). In Nebraska, nests averaged 34 centimeters high in alfalfa (MEDICAGO SATIVA) and wild rose (ROSA SP.) (Von Steen 1965). In an Illinois oldfield, nested in live forbs and dead vegetation; most nests were in wild aster (ASTER PILOSUS), but nests in dead vegetation were more productive (Harmeson 1972, 1974). Nests in trees or hedges in Illinois were 0.6-1.8 meters high (Gross 1968). In Missouri, most nests were found in individual forb plants; nests were occasionally placed above the ground in clumps of grass or in shrubs (Sauer 1953, Skinner et al. 1984, Winter 1998). In Iowa placed nests in forbs, grasses, shrubs, and deciduous tree saplings (Best et al. 1981). Nests in Texas were associated with woody plants and were surrounded by dense grass or forbs (Roth 1980). Within tallgrass prairie in Texas, nests were located most often in green milkweed (ASCLEPIAS VIRIDIFLORA), sensitive briar (SCHRANKIA ROEMERIANA), and eastern gammagrass (TRIPSACUM DACTYLOIDES) (Steigman 1993). <br><br>Hayland is used more frequently for nesting than cropland (Gross 1968, Faanes and Lingle 1995). In Nebraska, hayland was commonly used for nesting, with fewer nests found in wet prairie, wetland, upland prairie, lowland forest, or cropland (Von Steen 1965, Faanes and Lingle 1995). Ducey and Miller (1980) found unsuccessful nests in alfalfa (nest loss was caused by mowing) and oat fields (unknown cause of nest loss) in Nebraska. In Illinois, hayland was preferred for nesting, whereas no nests were found in pasture or cropland (Gross 1968). In Wisconsin also commonly nested in hayfields (Taber 1947). <br><br>Occasionally nest in strip cover such as roadside ditches, fencerows, and grassed waterways (Gross 1921; Meanley 1963; Basore et al. 1986; Bryan and Best 1991, 1994; Camp and Best 1994; Warner 1994). In Illinois, nested in wider tracts of strip cover, such as waterways (7-28 meters wide) as opposed to fencerows (1-3 meters wide) (Warner 1994). Nests were found in grassed waterways in Iowa (Bryan and Best 1991, 1994) and road rights-of-way in Nebraska (Hergenrader 1962) that were planted to smooth BROME (BROMUS INERMIS). In Iowa, preferred nesting in strip cover over tilled or untilled (idle in fall and spring and containing year-round crop residue) cropland (Basore et al. 1986). The probability of occurrence was significantly greater in Iowa grassed waterways that had greater forb cover than those with lesser forb cover (Bryan and Best 1994). In Arkansas, densities were higher in brushy roadside borders than in open fields (Meanley 1963). Nests in road rights-of-way or other edge habitats, however, can experience high rates of depredation (Basore et al. 1986, Camp and Best 1994). <br><br>In portions of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, abundance was related positively to percent grass cover, percent litter cover, vegetation density, vegetation height, and litter depth (Rotenberry and Wiens 1980). In Iowa, abundance was related negatively to tree species richness, density, and size, as well as sapling density and the horizontal patchiness of trees (Best et al. 1981). In Nebraska, abundance was related positively to litter depth, vertical density, and percent forb cover (Delisle and Savidge 1997). In a Michigan alfalfa field, occupied areas of low plant diversity; low vegetation density at a height of 5 centimeters; and high litter cover, vegetation height, and vertical density of vegetation (Harrison 1974). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: A variety of open habitats, second growth, and scrub (AOU 1998). Often in rice-growing regions in winter (Ehrlich et al. 1992). Prefers to roost in sugarcane (SACCHARUM spp.) fields, but if not available, will utilize bamboo, cattail marshes, grasses, and shrubs (Basili and Temple 1999)."
Setophaga kirtlandii,"Habitat includes open woodlands, forest and woodland edges, edges of lakes and streams, grassy fields, parks, farm yards, orchards, and areas with similar vegetation structure. Nests usually are in trees or shrubs, usually within 1-6 meters of the ground but may be higher."
Setophaga magnolia,"Old fields, brushy hillsides, overgrown pastures, thorn scrub, deciduous forest edge, sparse second growth, fencerows (AOU 1983). Early nests on or near ground in weed clumps or grass tufts, later nests may be higher in small thick shrubs as leaves grow, to about 30 centimeters above ground (Harrison 1978). Suitable habitat includes oldfields, sage (ARTEMISIA) flats, weedy pastures, untilled and idle cropland, Conservation Reserve Program fields, grassed waterways, hedgerows, shelterbelts, orchards, woodland edges, brushy woodlands, wooded draws, pine (PINUS) plantations, attenuated gallery and gallery forest, and reclaimed strip mines (Gabrielson 1914; Ely 1957; Graber and Graber 1963; Walkinshaw 1968; Stewart 1975; Best 1977, 1978; Evans 1978; Johnsgard 1980; Stauffer and Best 1980; Whitmore 1980; Best et al. 1981, 1997; Faanes 1981, 1983; Buech 1982; Hopkins 1983; Sousa 1983; Dinsmore et al. 1984; Kahl et al. 1985; Basore et al. 1986; Sample 1989; Bryan and Best 1991; Herkert 1991a; Cable et al. 1992; Zimmerman 1993; Carey et al. 1994; Vickery et al. 1994; Faanes and Lingle 1995). Woody vegetation and dense grass appear to be critical components for habitat suitability (Johnston 1947, Kupsky 1970, Lanyon 1981, Sousa 1983, Laubach 1984, Herkert 1991a). Optimal habitat was described as areas greater than 2 hectares containing dense, moderately tall grass, low to moderate shrub density with 50-75 percent of shrubs less than 1.5 meters tall, and shrub cover between 15-35 percent . Areas where most shrubs were less than 1.5 meters in height were considered too sparse in providing adequate numbers of perch sites, whereas areas where most shrubs were taller than 1.5 meters were considered too sparse in providing adequate numbers of possible nest sites. Areas with more than 75 percent shrub cover were too dense to be suitable breeding habitat (Sousa 1983). <br><br>The key to determining suitability of an area for nesting in Illinois was the availability of shrubs, trees, or other substrates that could be used as song perches; sparrows stayed within or near the forest edge, not venturing deeper than a few meters into the forest, nor farther than 12-15 meters into surrounding fields (Johnston 1947). In Illinois, preferred shrub-grassland, where shrubs and trees were less than 8 meters tall, over adjacent grassland or woodland edge; shrub-grassland offered an assemblage of grasses, forbs, trees, and shrubs to accommodate temporal shifts in the nesting and foraging preferences (Best 1974a, 1977). All available shrub-grassland habitat was encompassed within territories, whereas not all grassland or woodland edge habitat was encompassed within territories. Within riparian habitats ranging from hayfields to closed canopy woodlands in Iowa, density was positively correlated to species richness of shrubs; 67 percent of nine nests were built in shrubs, 22 percent in evergreen trees, and 11 percent in forbs (Stauffer and Best 1980, Best et al. 1981). Also in Iowa, preferred grassy areas with shrubs or low trees (Laubach 1984). In Wisconsin, density was positively correlated with percent woody cover and total number of dead stems (Sample 1989). In North Dakota, were attracted to wooded draws with a high shrub density (Faanes 1983). In Missouri, occupied grasslands and idle areas were characterized by low to intermediate canopy height (2-8 meters, never more than 8 meters), few woody stems less than 2.5 centimeters diameter at breast height (dbh) (approximately 350-700 per hectare), and moderate numbers of woody stems more than 2.5 centimeters dbh (approximately 25-50 per hectare) (Kahl et al. 1985). Moderate amounts of dense grass also are important (Sousa 1983). Optimal grass density is 50-90 percent canopy cover, which provides adequate nesting cover, abundant food sources, and ease of movement through vegetation (Sousa 1983). Optimal height of herbaceous vegetation during May and June is 16-32 centimeters; vegetation with an average height more than 40 centimeters provides suboptimal habitat and vegetation with an average height less than 5 centimeters provides inadequate concealment (Sousa 1983). In Wisconsin, preferred habitats that were relatively undisturbed, that were uncultivated, and that contained an average of 75 percent herbaceous cover (Sample 1989). In an Ohio oldfield, foraged in grasses in higher frequencies than expected based on their availability (Kupsky 1970). In Michigan, preferred to nest in residual stands of Indiangrass (SORGHASTRUM NUTANS) over residual stands of big bluestem (ANDROPOGON GERARDII) because most of the big bluestem was prostrate whereas most of the Indiangrass was upright (Best 1974a). <br><br>Nests on or near the ground in weed clumps, grass tufts, or litter usually at or near the base of woody vegetation early in the breeding season (May-June), but nest in small shrubs and saplings later in the breeding season as vegetative cover increases in height (Walkinshaw 1936, 1945; Crooks 1948; Crooks and Hendrickson 1953; Nolan 1963; Best 1974a, 1978; Evans 1978; Sousa 1983; Carey et al. 1994). Nest height ranges from 0 to 4.4 meters above ground (Walkinshaw 1936, 1945; Crooks 1948; George 1952; Ely 1957; Nolan 1963; Kupsky 1970; Best 1978; Evans 1978; Lanyon 1981; Buech 1982; Laubach 1984; Carey et al. 1994; D. E. Burhans, pers. comm.), but height is dependent upon time of season and substrate type. Based on the observations of one male that returned to the same Michigan site for 6 years, May nests were on the ground, and June and July nests averaged 26.0 centimeters and 40.5 centimeters above the ground, respectively (Walkinshaw 1945). In Iowa, six of 11 nests built in May were above ground with an average height of 16 centimeters; by June, six of 10 nests were above ground with an average height of 40 centimeters, and by July, all of the 11 nests found were above ground with an average of 51 centimeters (Crooks 1948). May nest in woody vegetation after foliage becomes dense enough to conceal nests (Crooks 1948, Nolan 1963). Best (1978), however, found preference for use of residual grasses as a nesting substrate over live grasses or woody vegetation that had leafed out. As long as isolated clumps of residual grass remained exposed from new growth, nested in residual grass; once residual grass was covered by live grasses, nested in woody vegetation. <br><br>Other important habitat features are vegetation patchiness, species richness of herbaceous and woody vegetation, and slope (Stauffer and Best 1980, Best et al.1981, Sample 1989, Vickery et al. 1994). In riparian habitats in Iowa, densities were positively correlated to horizontal patchiness of shrubs, vertical patchiness of trees, slope, and species richness of grass-like vegetation, shrubs, and evergreen trees; densities were negatively correlated to tree density and tree size, species richness of vines, and vertical stratification of vegetation (Stauffer and Best 1980, Best et al. 1981). In Maine grassland barrens, abundance was positively correlated to habitat patchiness, litter, shrub cover, and short grass, and negatively correlated to bare ground (Vickery 1993, Vickery et al. 1994). Density in Wisconsin was positively correlated to plant species richness (Sample 1989). In Iowa, all 15 breeding territories in an idle pasture were located on semi-wooded hillsides or lowlands (Crooks and Hendrickson 1953)."
Setophaga palmarum,"Open and partly open situations, especially along watercourses with steep banks, and roadside cuts. Nests in burrows in cliffs, riverbanks, roadside cuts, culverts, drain pipes, holes in walls, under bridges; locally in caves and old buildings (RIDGWAYI group). In Costa Rica, often nests in burrow dug by motmot or kingfisher (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Setophaga pensylvanica,"NON-BREEDING: mostly pelagic, less frequently along seacoasts, casually on large inland bodies of water (AOU 1983). <br><br>BREEDING: Nests on barren and dwarf-shrub coastal tundra; in shallow depression on the ground; generally on mound or slight rise in low wet tundra."
Setophaga petechia,"NON-BREEDING: primarily pelagic, less often in bays and harbors, casually on large inland bodies of water (AOU 1983, Pratt et al. 1987). BREEDING: Nests on swampy or mossy tundra, and flats near seacoasts; on the ground in a shallow depression on mound on elevated site. Breeding distribution varies with abundance of small mammals (especially brown lemming)."
Setophaga pinus,"Freshwater and salt marshes, in migration and winter also seacoasts, bays, estuaries, rivers and lakes (AOU 1983). Nests on inland lakes and marshes, or on salt marshes (especially on wrack) along the coast. Along the Gulf Coast, commonly nests on dredged material as well as on wrack in salt marshes. At San Francisco Bay, California, commonly nests on old dikes or dredged-material islets in salt evaporation ponds. Nests on floating mass of marsh plants, on muskrat house, or old grebe's nest, or in a depression lined with grasses and pieces of shells. Human-made nesting platforms made of bundles of PHRAGMITES or TYPHA on floating base of styrofoam and wood or tires were readily used for nesting in Wisconsin (see Spendelow and Patton 1988). See Spendelow and Patton (1988) for further information on freshwater nesting habitats. See Cuthbert and Louis (1993) for information on nesting habitat in Minnesota."
Setophaga ruticilla,"Seacoasts, estuaries, bays, lakes, rivers, and marshes. Nests on sandy, pebbly, or stony beaches, matted vegetation, marsh islands, and grassy areas; typically on isolated, sparsely vegetated islands in large lakes or along coast, also in rivers. Breeds successfully on human-made islands, including navigational aids or cribs (Karwowski et al. 1995). See Spendelow and Patton (1988) and Ramos and del Nevo (1995) for further details on nesting habitat in different regions."
Setophaga striata,"BREEDING: Seacoasts, beaches, bays, estuaries, lagoons, lakes, and rivers (AOU 1983). Rests and loafs on sandy beaches, mudflats, and salt-pond dikes (Stiles and Skutch 1989). In California, may roost at night on sandy beaches away from nesting areas for several weeks before nesting. Nests usually in shallow depression on level ground on sandy or gravelly beaches and banks of rivers or lakes, typically in areas with sparse or no vegetation (usually less than 20% vegetation cover, often 10% or less; Bent 1921, Craig 1971, Jernigan et al. 1978, Thompson and Slack 1982, Faanes 1983, Gochfeld 1983, USFWS 1990); also on dredge spoils; on mainland or on barrier island beaches; and on flat gravel-covered rooftops of buildings (especially in the southeastern U.S.) or other similarly barren artificial sites (AOU 1983). Good nesting areas tend to be well beyond the high tide mark, have shell particles/stones/debris for egg camouflage (Burger and Gochfeld 1990), be out of the way of off-road vehicles and public recreation areas, not subject to unusual predation pressure, and adjacent to plentiful sources of small fishes. Colonies on small islands usually experience less mammalian predation (Burger 1984). Good roof-top sites provide some shade for chicks. <br><br>Adults do not require cover during the breeding season, but chicks may use sparse vegetation and debris for shade and protection (Hardy 1957, Blodgett 1978). Parents may lead chicks toward the periphery of the colony into more heavily vegetated areas (Akers 1975), where the young utilize debris and vegetation for cover (Hardy 1957). In coastal areas, beach grass (AMMOPHILA BREVILIUnrankable LATA) is the commonly associated vegetation. Along river systems, willow (SALIX spp.) is the common vegetation adjacent to sites (Sidle, pers. comm.). On Oklahoma salt flats, almost 60% of the nests were within 5 cm of debris (Grover and Knopf 1982). <br><br>Interior populations nest mainly on riverine sandbars or salt flats that become exposed during periods of low water (Hardy 1957). As a result of vegetational succession and/or erosion, preferred nesting habitat typically is ephemeral. Hardy (1957) implied that breeding in riverine situations depends on the presence of sandbars, favorable water levels during nesting season, and sufficient food. Nests are usually located at higher elevations and away from the water. Water levels determine the size of sand bars and the extent of nesting areas (USFWS 1990). Dams above colonies generally lower habitat quality by eliminating the spring floods that are necessary for alluvium deposition and the scouring of vegetation. Ducey (1982) reported successful breeding at two privately-owned sand and gravel companies along the Platte River in Nebraska. As old breeding sites became unsuitable due to vegetation encroachment, the terns simply moved to more recently created sand deposits. See also Ziewitz et al. (1992) for information on nesting habitat in the Platte River in Nebraska. Populations in Kansas have nested on oil well sites (Schulenberg and Ptacek 1984). <br><br>Since least terns always nest near water, they are vulnerable to flood inundation and seem to seek high ground. In coastal Texas, Thompson and Slack (1982) documented that the densest nesting area in 67% of the colonies was above the midpoint of available elevations. Gochfeld (1983) found that terns on Long Island avoid beaches that have less than 32.8 feet (10 m) of width beyond the hightide mark. Interior least tern nests on salt plains in Oklahoma were located an average of 110.5 m away from the nearest water (Grover and Knopf 1982). However, nests on the Platte River in Nebraska, were located at an average of 18.9 m away from the nearest river channel on sand bars that averaged 58.9 m wide (Faanes 1983). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: flocks have been found at sea, often far from land, in southeastern Caribbean and adjacent Atlantic off Guianas (van Halewyn and Norton 1984)."
Setophaga tigrina,"Open woodland to scrub and desert, and around human habitation (AOU 1989)."
Setophaga virens,"Dense woodland and forest (coniferous or hardwood), swamps, wooded river valleys, cabbage palm-live oak hammocks; often in areas bordering streams, marshes, and meadows (AOU 1983), but also commonly in upland areas; habitat use reflects vegetation characteristics rather than proximity of water per se. Generally in expansive forested area with large mature and decadent trees that provide cavities suitable for security and nesting (Allen 1987). Appears to prefer older stands but uses earlier stages of forest succession if enough large trees or snags (or nest boxes) are present (Allen 1987). Often in forests with relatively open understory. Prefers canopy closure of 60% or greater. Often replaced by the great horned owl in fragmented open forests. <br><br>Nests in tree cavity, in abandoned nest of squirrel, crow, or hawk, or in top of hollow tree stub, usually at least 7-8 m above ground. Uses both living and dead trees. Trees with cavity suitable for nesting generally at least 51 cm DBH; habitat suitability index model assumes that a density of at least 2 stems of this diameter per 0.4 ha represents high quality habitat for reproduction; high quality reproductive habitat also indicated by canopy cover of overstory trees of 60% or more (Allen 1987). Nest sites typically used in successive years."
Sialia sialis,"Grasslands, savanna, open fields, pastures, cultivated lands, sometimes marshes. In southeastern Arizona, avoided recently burned grassland habitats (Southwest. Nat. 37:73). Nests on the ground in concealing herbage."
Sitta canadensis,"Found in a wide variety of habitats including open wood- lands, agricultural and urban areas. Roosts in trees, shrubs, or buildings, forages in open areas (Godfrey 1966). May use cavity as night roost during nonbreeding season; this cavity may be used for nesting by same bird(s). Cavity nester. Nests in tree hole, woodpecker hole, axil of coconut palm, bird box, or crevice in building. Competes with flicker, Lewis's Woodpecker, Gila Woodpecker, Great Crested Flycatcher, bluebirds, and other cavity nesters for nest sites."
Sitta carolinensis,"Open situations near water, including streams, lakes, ponds, marshes and coastal regions (AOU 1983); savanna, pastures, etc. Nests usually near water in a natural tree cavity or abandoned woodpecker hole, less frequently in open woodland away from water. Also nests in bird boxes or in a crevice in a building. Territoriality may limit use of suitable nest sites. Tends to return to same nest site in subsequent years if reproduction successful; first-year breeders return to nest usually within 100 km or less of natal site (Turner and Rose 1989)."
Sitta pusilla,"Seacoasts, lagoons, estuaries, rarely on lakes (AOU 1983). Loafs and sleeps on mudflats, sandspits, or salt-pond dikes (Stiles and Skutch 1989). <br><br>Nests typically on open sandy beaches of barrier islands, sandbars, sand/shell substrates; also on newly created dredged-material islands (Spendelow and Patton 1988); on remote cays in Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. Colony site requirements: absence of quadruped predators; isolation from disturbance, combined with excellent visibility; proximity to areas of extensive shallows; and proximity to oceanic inlets (Buckley and Buckley 1984). Colonies in the eastern U.S. regularly change location (Buckley and Buckley 1984)."
Spatula clypeata,"Seacoasts, bays, estuaries, mudflats, river mouths, lagoons. In North America, nests with royal tern on unvegetated bare sand or sand-shell substrates on barrier beaches, sandflats, or dredge-spoil islands; sometimes in association with laughing gull or black skimmer. Colonies occur on dredged material islands in North Carolina, on barrier islands in South Carolina, both types of sites in Florida and Texas; the largest colonies in Louisiana occur on barrier beaches of Chandeleur Islands (Spendelow and Patton 1988)."
Spatula discors,"BREEDING: Uses brushy areas, thickets and scrub in open country, open and riparian woodland, and chaparral. More commonly in arid regions but locally also in humid areas (subtropical and temperate zones) including country towns and farms (AOU 1983). In southwestern North America, primary habitats include chaparral, brushy slopes, pinyon-juniper, live-oak, and mesquite associations. In southwestern Wyoming, preferred woodlands with a combination of pinyon pine and high overstory juniper cover (Pavlacky and Anderson 2001). Along the northern Pacific coast, occurrences are in rough country, clearcut forests, open second-growth, and in the vicinity of human habitations (Bent 1948). In eastern North America, generally occurs at higher elevations of the Appalachians in farmyards, brushy places, openings and edges of woodlands, and overgrown fields. Typically nests in natural tree cavities or among crannies formed by exposed roots. May use small cavities in human-made objects including fence posts, buildings, or bird houses. <br/><br/>Its habitat during the period of peak abundance and expansion in 1800s and early 1900s was different from that of the current population. For example, in North Carolina during the early 1900s, wrens commonly occurred in towns and farmyards at all elevations of the mountains (Pearson et al. 1942, Potter et al. 1980). Most of the North Carolina records since 1950 have been in forest openings, pastures with fences and brushpiles that are away from human habitation and above 4.000 feet. <br/><br/>NON-BREEDING: eastern birds abandon montane habitats, moving into weedy open country, especially around old farm buildings, brushpiles, and fencerows, at lower elevations."
Sphyrapicus varius,"Open deciduous woodland, mostly in undergrowth and thickets; parks; also shrubbery of residential areas, hammocks, swamps, pine barrens; humid forest edge and clearings. <br><br>Nests in small niche or cavity in tree trunk or stump, in a crotch, among roots, in a bank, or among low undergrowth, usually less than 3 m above ground; also nests in various cavities or niches around buildings (Harrison 1978), including potted plants."
Sphyrapicus varius appalachiensis,"Thickets and bushy areas in deciduous forest clearings and forest edge, shrubby areas and gardens; in migration and winter also in scrub (AOU 1983). BREEDING: Nests on ground under small bush or as high as about 4 m in tree, shrub, vine."
Spinus pinus,"Nonbreeding: marshes, ponds, wet meadows, lakes and mudflats (AOU 1983), coastal salinas. Nests in muskeg country, to edge of tundra, in marshes and bogs, clearings or burned-over sections of black spruce forest. The nest is a depression in the ground. It may be located on a slope, far from water (Terres 1980)."
Spinus tristis,"Nonbreeding: marshes, ponds, lakes, stream margins and sand and gravel bars, lagoons, salinas, and coastal mudflats (AOU 1983, Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests in muskeg country or at other wetlands, on the ground in a slight depression in moss or dry peat, usually near water."
Spiza americana,"Marshes, tidal mudflats, beaches, lake margins, mangroves, tidal channels, river mouths, coastal lagoons, sandy or rocky shores, and, less frequently, open grassland (AOU 1983, Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nests along marshy lake margins in western North America, salt marshes in eastern North America. Nests on the ground in open places, coastal marshes, beaches, or islands; and inland in wet grassland by lakes, or short grass or bare ground by water. <br><br>Breeding requires large expanses of short, sparse grasslands for nesting and foraging, and wetland complexes for foraging (Stewart 1975; Weber 1978; Kantrud and Stewart 1984; Ryan and Renken 1987; Colwell and Oring 1988a, 1990; Kantrud and Higgins 1992; Prescott et al. 1995). In both upland and wetland habitats, adults with broods use somewhat taller, denser grass cover than do breeding pairs during nesting (Ryan and Renken 1987). In North Dakota, uplands used by Willets had a thinner litter layer than surrounding areas (Renken 1983). They often nest near a conspicuous object such as a piece of wood, dried cattle dung, or a stone (Higgins et al. 1979, Kantrud and Higgins 1992). <br><br>Prefer native grass to tame vegetation (Stewart 1975, Ryan and Renken 1987, Kantrud and Higgins 1992). They prefer pastures that are idle during the nesting season, and to a lesser extent actively grazed pasture, to other land-use types (Higgins et al. 1979, Ryan and Renken 1987, Kantrud and Higgins 1992). Although tilled lands usually are avoided (Weber 1978), nests have been reported in hayland and cropland, including small-grain, flax, and stubble fields (Higgins et al. 1979, Kantrud and Higgins 1992). In North Dakota, pairs nesting in native vegetation had higher hatching success than pairs nesting in cultivated fields (Higgins et al. 1979). In the prairie and aspen parkland regions of Alberta, mean number of birds/site was nonstatistically compared among several habitats (Prescott et al. 1995, Prescott 1997). In prairie, were most abundant in native mixed-grass, followed by coulee, upland shrub, planted cropland, and hayland (Prescott 1997). Coulee was defined as a valley containing an ephemeral creek or seepage that may contain other, undescribed, habitat types. Hayland was planted to grasses (species not given) or alfalfa (MEDICAGO SATIVA). In the uplands of aspen parkland, were most abundant in deferred native pastures grazed after 15 July, followed by idle native grassland, continuously grazed native parkland, and tame dense nesting cover (Prescott et al. 1995). They were not found in tame pasture, deferred tame pasture, idle tame uplands, idle tame grasslands, continuously grazed native grasslands, idle parkland, or native dense nesting cover. <br><br>In wetlands, avoid dense, emergent vegetation, preferring shallow-water areas with short, sparse shoreline vegetation (Ryan and Renken 1987, Colwell and Oring 1988a, Eldridge in prep.). Suitable wetlands range in salinity from fresh to saline, and vary widely in size and permanence (Stewart 1975, Kantrud and Stewart 1984, Ryan and Renken 1987, Prescott et al. 1995, Eldridge in prep.). In North Dakota, were more common in alkali or permanent wetlands than in temporary, seasonal, or semipermanent wetlands (D. H. Johnson et al., unpubl. data). Shifts in wetland use occur seasonally and during climatic extremes (Ryan and Renken 1987; Gratto-Trevor, in press). Semipermanent wetlands were used most often, but ephemeral, temporary, seasonal, and alkali ponds were preferred relative to their availability (Ryan and Renken 1987). Semipermanent wetlands were used later in the summer than other wetland types. Semipermanent and permanent wetlands were used during drought years."
Spizella passerina,"BREEDING: Nests on taiga. Nests in trees in abandoned passerine nests near muskeg and woodland ponds or pools. Also reported as nesting on ground in areas above treeline in Brooks Range, Alaska (see Johnson and Herter 1989). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: freshwater ponds, stream edges, temporary pools, flooded ditches and fields, more commonly in wooded regions, less frequently on mudflats and open marshes (AOU 1983); favors areas where vegetation extends to water's edge (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Spizella pusilla,"House wrens inhabit thickets, shrubbery, and brushy areas in partly open situations, open woodland, farmlands, chaparral, and areas around human habitations; also (south of the United States) humid montane forest, forest edge, clearings, pine-oak associations, and mangroves. This species occurs most often in human-disturbed habitats. It sleeps in all seasons in crannies in buildings, holes in trees, niches in banks, or in similar sites. Nests usually are in cavities (natural, abandoned woodpecker holes, bird boxes, and within various human artifacts). <br><br>House wrens commonly reuse nesting cavities in successive years. Prior to reuse, the male usually removes the old nest-lining and sometimes the old sticks as well. Removal of old nest material can significantly reduce the abundance of parasitic mites that may attack the wrens."
Stelgidopteryx serripennis,"Coniferous forest (especially spruce and fir) and mixed forests, primarily with dense understory; in migration and winter also in deciduous forest and woodland with dense undergrowth and tree-falls, dense hedgerows, and brushy fields (AOU 2010).<br>"
Stercorarius parasiticus,"American robins use a wide range of habitats, including forest, woodland, scrub, parks, thickets, gardens, cultivated lands, savanna, swamps, and suburbs. They are attracted to areas with  damp ground or small fruits. Nests are in forks or on branches of trees or shrubs, on building ledges, sometimes on fences, posts, or cliff ledges, or rarely on the ground; usually 1-6 meters above ground."
Stercorarius pomarinus,"Open situations with scattered trees, most frequently in insular or coastal areas, including in mangroves and along beaches (AOU 1983), and pine plantations (Collazo and Bonilla 1988). Jamaica: low-lying open woodland, chiefly near cleared areas; locally in mangroves; abundant in open wooded cultivation at mid-levels and in mountains (Lack 1976). BREEDING: Nests in mangroves, and in pines and other trees; in towns in inland areas."
Sterna forsteri,"Forest edge, open situations with scattered trees and shrubs, cultivated lands with bushes and fencerows, and parks; in winter more closely associated with forest clearings and borders (AOU 1983). Migrants in Costa Rica roost in isolated clumps of trees or amid tall coarse grass (Stiles and Skutch 1989). BREEDING: Nests usually on horizontal limb of isolated tree or orchard tree, in low shrub at water's edge, or on stump or snag in water; average height of 3-6 m (Terres 1980)."
Sterna hirundo,"Open and partly open country, especially savanna, agricultural lands, and areas with scattered trees (AOU 1983), also desert. In western Nebraska, used habitat types have large, widely spaced cottonwood trees with abundant grass cover below (Bergin 1992). BREEDING: Nests in trees (usually out on a limb, sometimes near trunk); may also nest on shrubs, fence posts, or buildings. Nest usually about 4.5-9 m from ground. In Nebraska, nests in larger, taller trees with more available perches (Bergin 1992)."
Sternula antillarum,"BREEDING: Fields of dense grass. Open and partly open country (grassland, marsh, lightly grazed pasture, hayfields) in a wide variety of situations, often around human habitation (AOU 1983). Nests in buildings (church steeples, attics, platforms in silos and barns, wooden water tanks, duckblinds), caves, crevices on cliffs, burrows, and hollow trees, rarely in trees with dense foliage (AOU 1983). Caves, cliff crevices, and cut bank burrows are commonly used in the western U.S., rarely in the east. Uses nest boxes (Marti and Wagner 1985). Reproductive success generally is higher in a properly placed and maintained nest box than in a natural nest cavity. <br><br>FORAGING HABITAT: Dense grass fields are the chief foraging habitat, including saltmarsh, wet meadows, lightly grazed pastures, grass hayfields, and recently abandoned agricultural fields (Colvin 1980, 1984, 1985; Rosenburg 1986; Gubanyi 1989). Radiotelemetry studies indicate that these habitats are actively selected (Colvin 1984, Rosenburg 1986, Gubanyi 1989). Furthermore, the quantity and quality of dense grass habitats are significantly correlated with nest activity (Colvin and Hegdal 1988). <br><br>Other habitats occasionally used include alfalfa/grass (Colvin 1984), small grain (Ault 1971, Rosenburg 1986), fencelines, and roadsides (Ault 1971, Byrd 1982). In an intensively farmed area in eastern Virginia where grass availability was very low, foraged in small grain, a five-year-old clearcut, barnyards, and a pine (PINUS spp.) plantation used as a blackbird roost (Rosenburg 1986). Cultivated habitats in general are of little importance because of low prey populations and/or dense protective cover (Colvin 1984, Rosenburg 1986). <br><br>NESTING HABITAT: This is a cavity-nesting bird which uses natural as well as human-created cavities. Tree cavities are the principal nest site used in most areas of the Northeast (Colvin et al. 1984); those most frequently used are silver maple (ACER SACCHARINUM), American sycamore (PLATANUS OCCIDENTALIS), and white oak (QUERCUS ALBA) (Colvin et al. 1984, Byrd and Rosenburg 1986). Although cut bank burrows and cliff recesses are frequently used in the western U.S. (Otteni et al. 1972, Martin 1973, Rudolph 1978, Millsap and Millsap 1987, Gubanyi 1989), only a few cases of the use of such sites have been reported in the Northeast. R. Ferren (pers. comm.) described nest holes in the steep bluffs on the north and south ends of Block Island, Rhode Island. Recesses in a clay embankment along the Patuxent River in Maryland supported a breeding pair during the late 1980s (S. Smith, pers. comm.). Exposed barrels in a cut bank along the Rappahannock River of eastern Virginia supported approximately 15 nesting pairs in the late 1970s (S. Doggett, pers. comm.). A wide variety of human-made ""cavities"" are used as nest sites. Large platforms within barns and silos, tunnels dug into silage in roofed or topless silos, cavities among hay bales stored inside barns, barn cupola shelves, wooden water tanks, and offshore duckblinds are frequently used; feed bins, church steeples and belfries, platforms within commercial and industrial buildings (e.g., warehouses, grain elevators, mills, factories), attics of abandoned or occupied houses, ledges within chimneys, platforms beneath bridges, and World War II cement watch towers are occasionally used (Stotts 1958, Scott 1959, Reese 1972, Klaas et al. 1978, Soucy 1979, Bunn et al. 1982, Hegdal and Blaskiewicz 1984, Colvin 1984, Byrd and Rosenburg 1986, Matteson and Petersen 1988, Parker and Castrale 1990). In addition, nest boxes are readily used (Otteni et al. 1972, Marti et al. 1979, Soucy 1980, Ziesemer 1980, Colvin et al. 1984, Cook 1985, Schulz 1986, Byrd and Rosenburg 1986, Bendel and Therres 1988, Parker and Castrale 1990). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In winter often roosts in dense conifers; also roosts in nest boxes if available (Marti and Wagner 1985)."
Streptopelia decaocto,"Moist deciduous woodland and swamp. In migration and winter also open woodland, pine, and scrub (AOU 1983). Apparently adapted to swampy canebreaks or bamboo thickets (Remson 1986). Variously has been regarded as a bird of virgin bottomland forests and swamp forests, and as a second-growh species (see Morse 1989). <br><br>Nests in bushes, blackberry vines, or canes, on swamp palmetto leaf, in densest watery swamps, at height of 0.6-1.5 m. <br><br>Experimental cuts have been made on the Francis Marion National Forest (South Carolina) in an attempt to duplicate the preferred nesting habitat; Hurricane Hugo destroyed most of the large timber there in the fall of 1989; possibly this resulted in more favorable nesting habitat (USFWS 1990)."
Strix varia,"BREEDING: Deciduous woodland, usually in dry uplands or areas of thick undergrowth in swampy areas; woodland edge with low cover; hillside scrub; overgrown pastures; abandoned farmland; powerline right-of-ways; recently logged sites; bogs; forest openings; territories usually have patches of herbs and shrubs, sparse tree cover, and a wooded perimeter (Confer 1992). Habitat tracts of 10-15 ha can support several pairs and are preferred over both smaller and larger areas (Confer 1992). Habitat can be created through logging, burning, and intermittent farming (Confer 1992). Habitat is ephemeral and requires periodic disturbance to return it to favorable early successional conditions. Nests on or a little above ground, in grass tuft, fern or weed clump, or concealed in herbage at base of shrub, tree, ferns, briars, or goldenrod (Harrison 1978, Confer 1992). Often the clump includes a taller stem used for descent to the nest. Nests usually at the ecotone of a forest with a field or marsh, or in a small opening in a forest (Confer 1992). <br><br>Nested abundantly in the chestnut-sprout (CASTANEA DENTATA) forests of West Virginia following the spread of the chestnut blight (Hall 1983). Commonly nest in upland sites on abandoned farmland in early stages of succession (e.g., Confer and Knapp 1981), or occasionally in logged areas (e.g., Will 1986). In the Canadian shield in Ontario, they nest ""...in alder [ALNUS spp.] bogs, especially when a few taller species [of trees] are present"" (Mills 1987). Several observers have mentioned nesting in powerline right-of-ways. In southern Michigan they nested in and around the edges of thickly wooded portions of tamarack (LARIX LARICINA) swamps as well as in small, brushy clearings (Will 1986). In northern Michigan, Will described their habitat as including dry fields overgrown with shrubs, and woodland clearings, as well as very wet areas that were recently logged and covered with felled trees and a homogenous cover of new saplings. Will suggested that, overall, they ""...appeared to require proximal access to mature or second-growth woodlands as well as open areas in which there has been considerable invasion by brush, shrubs, and sapling trees."" <br><br>Vegetative characteristics of territories have been quantified for southern, central, and northern New York (Confer and Knapp 1981, Frech and Confer 1987). In southern New York and contiguous New Jersey, nesting takes place in the Ramapo Mountains (Confer and Knapp 1981, Skully, in press). In this rugged topography, territories occurred in marshes between rock outcrops often with a perimeter of alder surrounded by forest. In central and northern New York, territories usually were located on dry, upland sites of abandoned farmland but occasionally in wet sites. All territories had areas with dense herb growth without shrubs or trees. Herb growth of at least moderate density covered 60% or more of the ground, including the growth under woody plants. All territories had patches of dense shrubs which covered about half of each territory. Tree canopy covered less than 15% of the northern and central territories but up to 40% of the southern territories. Central and northern territories usually extended no more than 20 m into a forest, while southern territories frequently extended considerably further. In wetter sites sedges (CAREX spp.) were the dominant herb and alders were the dominant shrub. In upland sites a wide variety of herbs occurred while VIBURNUM spp., narrow-leaved meadowsweet (SPIREA ALBA), and dogwood (CORNUS spp.) were the dominant shrubs. <br><br>All New York territories had a similar vegetative pattern with patches of herbs and shrubs, a few trees scattered throughout, and a tree row or forest edge forming most of the perimeter (Confer and Knapp 1981, Frech and Confer 1987). In New York, abandoned farmland undergoing secondary succession has this distinctive pattern of vegetation for only about 10-20 years. Thus, golden-winged warblers at upland sites are restricted to a specific and brief stage of succession. Because of this restriction, Confer and Knapp (1981) suggested that this warbler was in some sense a habitat specialist. However, a species that can nest in chestnut-sprout forests in Virginia, tamarack bogs in Michigan, and alder swamps in Ontario clearly tolerates a wide range of conditions. It would be valuable to determine if nesting warblers require a specific plant profile but tolerate a wide range of plant species, or tolerate a wide range of both plant profile and plant species. <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter in various open woodland habitats, pine-oak, and scrub, often in foothill regions (AOU 1983). Found in evergreen and semi-deciduous forest, particularly the canopy, gaps, or edges and in tall second growth (Stiles and Skutch 1989, DeGraaf and Rappole 1995, Howell and Webb 1995)."
Sturnella magna,"BREEDING: Brushy hillsides, second growth, partly open situations with saplings, bogs, woodland edge and clearings, stream edges, overgrown pastures, swamps. Nests close to or on ground, in bushes, weeds, or grasses, or under bushes, or between exposed roots of stump (Terres 1980). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter, occurs in brushy areas, scrub, and open woodland (Terres 1980). In the Yucatan, Mexico is a tropical forest specialist (Lynch 1989)."
Sturnus vulgaris,"BREEDING: Primarily open deciduous forest and woodland, riparian woodland, tall floodplain forest, lowland swamp forest, and less frequently, mixed forest; also orchards, groves, roadside trees. Most abundant in mature woods but also occurs in medium-aged forests and some pioneer stands; requires a high, partially open canopy and prefers woods with an intermediate tree density or basal area (Bushman and Therres 1988). Apparently has a relatively low tolerance to forest fragmentation, though this may depend on forest quality and proximity to other forested areas. Nests usually in the canopy of a deciduous tree, in horizontal twig fork, usually more than 6 m above ground (Harrison 1978). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter also in various forest, woodland, second growth, and mangrove habitats. In migration in more open areas and low scrub (Stiles and Skutch 1989)."
Tachycineta bicolor,"Open deciduous and mixed deciduous-coniferous woodland, riparian forest and thickets, pine-oak association, orchards, and parks; in migration and winter in a wide variety of forest, woodland and scrub habitats (AOU 1983). In winter seems to prefer light woodland and savanna groves (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Usually nests at end of branch in a deciduous tree, 9-18 m above ground, or 1-3.5 m above ground, in shrub or orchard tree (Terres 1980)."
Thalasseus maximus,"BREEDING: Inhabits early-late successional, shrubby habitats such as deciduous scrub, old fields, abandoned pastures, regenerating clearcuts or other heavily logged areas, drainage and streamside thickets, forest edges, reclaimed strip mines, and mangrove swamps (Bent 1950, Bradley 1980, Graber et al. 1985, Hopp et al. 1995, Mumford and Keller 1984, Palmer-Ball 1996). In east Texas, positively associated with high shrub density and species diversity, and foliage density (Conner et al. 1983). In Virginia, prefers habitats with extensive undergrowth, shrubs, and tree saplings interspersed with widely spaced taller trees (Hopp et al. 1995). Birds inhabiting the Atlantic coastal region of Georgia and the Carolinas prefer scrub lacking an overstory, whereas birds ranging from Alabama to Louisiana appear to prefer edge habitat (S. L. Hopp, pers. comm.). Nest is typically placed in a Y-shaped horizontal branch of a deciduous tree or shrub, 0.3-2.11 m above the ground (Hopp et al. 1995). <br><br>NON-BREEDING: Considered a habitat generalist on the wintering grounds. Observed in all habitat types surveyed on the Yucatan Peninsula, including field, pasture, acahual (shrubby, early successional habitat), semi-deciduous forest, semi-evergreen forest, moist tropical forest, mangrove forest and coastal scrub (Lynch 1989). In a habitat-use study of three habitat types on the Yucatan Peninsula (pasture, acahual and subtropical dry forest), observed most frequently in the latter (Greenberg 1992). Captured most frequently in pine savanna and early successional scrub in Belize (Petit et al. 1992). In Veracruz, Mexico, occupied young (1-10 m tall) and old (10-20 m tall) second-growth forest, as well as undisturbed evergreen tropical forest (Rappole and Warner 1980)."
Thalasseus sandvicensis,"Open deciduous (less frequently coniferous) forest (especially with sapling undergrowth), mixed forest with deciduous understory, second-growth woodland, scrub, thickets, gardens, mangroves. Most abundant in mature stands. In much of the range, prefers shady oak forests with a high, well-developed closed canopy and a fairly open understory with scanty ground cover (see Bushman and Therres 1988). Most common in forest tracts of at least 15-20 ha but may occur in patches as small as a few hectares (see Bushman and Therres 1988). Prefers closed canopy but tolerates a wide range of canopy closures. In Pennsylvania, more sensitive than other area-dependent birds to increased fragmentation via forest clear-cutting (Yahner 1993). In migration and winter in various open forest, forest edge, woodland, scrub, and brush habitats. Colombia: low to fairly high in shrubby clearings and forest borders (Hilty and Brown 1986). <br><br>Nests in fork of slender branch of shrub or low tree, 1-15 m (usually 1-3 m) above ground."
Thryomanes bewickii,"Open deciduous or mixed woodland, forest edge, second growth, parks, and alder and willow thickets, especially near streams. In migration and winter in various open woodland, and partly open situations with scattered trees. Nests in horizontal twig fork 3-12 m up in deciduous tree, usually near upper canopy (Harrison 1978)."
Thryomanes bewickii bewickii,"Mixed coniferous-deciduous woodland, humid montane forest (Sibley and Monroe 1990); in migration and winter also in ""a variety of wooded habitats, but favors tall woodland with live oaks and pines in the temperate zone (AOU 1998); in Costa Rica prefers forest edge and semi-open habitats (Stiles and Skutch 1989). Nest built in twig fork of shrub or conifer, 1-6 m (often less than 3 m) above ground."
Thryothorus ludovicianus,"BREEDING: Fresh-water marshes of cattail, tule or bulrushes (AOU 1983). The nest is a basketlike structure of wet grasses, reeds, cattails woven around stems. NON-BREEDING: In migration and winter also in open cultivated lands, pastures and fields (AOU 1983)."
Toxostoma rufum,"Habitats include open woodland, forest edge, cultivated lands with scattered trees and bushes, parks and suburban areas, arid and desert country (generally near water), and second growth (Tropical to Temperate zones). Nests are in trees or shrubs, sometimes on stumps or rocks or on building ledges, or on the ground. Individuals may nest in an old nest of another species or build its own platform of twigs."
Tringa flavipes,"Coniferous and mixed forest, forest edge, clearings, bogs, brush, thickets, open woodland. In migration and winter also in deciduous forest and woodland, scrub, shrubbery, gardens, parks, cattail marshes. BREEDING: Nests on ground at edge of clearing, usually by or under shrubs, tree branches, grass tufts, weed clumps, and ferns; exceptionally above ground in thick bushes or low in tree (Harrison 1978)."
Tringa melanoleuca,"Open woodlands, burnt over areas in forests, brushy areas, brushy subalpine meadows, willow thickets along streams or lakes, parks, farmland. <br><br>Nests on ground under cover of shrubs and ground vegetation, or in shrub or tree up to a few feet from ground."
Tringa semipalmata,"American alligators inhabit fresh and brackish marshes, ponds, lakes, rivers, swamps, bayous, canals, and large spring runs. They often bask on partially submerged logs or on land next to the water. Alligators dig dens in river or lake margins or in marshes; they spend cold winter and drought periods in the den They depend on access to air holes to survive in ice-covered ponds (Brandt and Mazotti 1990). <br><br>Copulation occurs in shallow water. Females deposit eggs in large mounded nests made of leaves, mud, rotting vegetation, rocks, or other debris. Nests are built in marshes or at lake or river margins. In north-central Florida, alligators nested in close proximity to permanent water, used a wide variety of available plant materials and soil in constructing nest (Goodwin and Marion 1978). Turtles (e.g., <i>Pseudemys nelsoni</i>) often lay eggs in alligator nests."
Tringa solitaria,"Ponds, creeks, rivers, marshes, and drainage canals (Behler and King 1979); occasionally in brackish estuaries (Schwartz and Henderson 1991). In Suriname, swamp-bordered river parts usually had higher population densities than did forest-bordered river parts; most juveniles and subadults found in area with much aquatic vegetation; dispersed into inundated swamps during high water (Ouboter and Nanhoe 1988). <br/><br/>Eggs are laid in a mounded nest of soil and vegetation (Behler and King 1979), at times some distance from water (Schwartz and Henderson 1991). In Brazil, nested in forest and on floating grass mats (Campos 1993). In Costa Rica, nested in forest adjacent to rivers or canals (Allsteadt 1994)."
Troglodytes aedon,The Sei whale generally occupies deep water along the edge of continental shelves and in open ocean.
Troglodytes hiemalis,"Pelagic; usually found in largest numbers 25 miles or more from shore. In the western Atlantic, occurs mainly over continental shelf in summer, in water 50-100 fathoms deep (Katona et al. 1983). Young are born in the warmer waters of the lower latitudes."
Turdus migratorius,"Open plains and grasslands in south; woodland and openings in boreal forest, meadows, and river valleys in north. Like other large grazers, attracted to burned areas the next growing season (Shaw and Carter 1990). During the growing season at the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas, preferred areas that had been burned in spring; summer grazing was concentrated in large watershed area (79-119 ha) dominated by warm-season, perennial C4 grasses; in fall and winter, grazed both burned and unburned watersheds more uniformly but grazed most intensively in areas with large stands of cool-season, C3 grasses (Vinton et al. 1993). Cows usually give birth in isolation where vegetation provides cover; isolation during birth is infrequent where cover is lacking (Meagher 1986)."
Tyrannus dominicensis,"Most abundant in hardwood forests with deep leaf-litter and abundant food; avoids areas with little cover and extremes of temperature and moisture. Semifossorial; digs tunnels or uses existing ones. Constructs elaborate underground nest. Nests are placed under logs or stumps, or underground."
Tyrannus tyrannus,"Various upland and wetland habitats, including moist deciduous woods, brushy areas, pine woodland and forest, mixed oak-pine-juniper woods, grassy situations, densely wooded floodplains. May favor areas with abundant leaf litter and fallen logs (Baumgardner et al. 1992). Nest sites are probably under logs, stumps and other debris."
Tyrannus verticalis,"Found in a wide range of habitats in its extensive range, from open prairies of the west to the heavily forested regions of the Northeast. In cities in some areas. <br><br>Examples of some recent habitat studies: In northern Vermont, preferred hardwood forests in winter and spring, farmland in summer and fall (Person and Hirth 1991). In British Columbia, preferred dense spruce forest and/or areas where snowshoe hare was abundant (Murray et al. 1994). <br><br>Young are born in a den usually in a burrow (enlarged burrow of other mammal or dug by female), with the opening often oriented toward the south. Dens also may be above ground (e.g., at base of tree under low, overhanging branches; in hollow log or rock crevice), or under building. Commonly uses same den in subsequent years."
Tyto alba,"No particular habitat preference. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, usually occurs in areas with few roads, which increase human access and incompatible land uses (Thiel 1985, Mech et al. 1988, Mech 1989) but apparently can occupy semi-wild lands if ungulate prey are abundant and if not killed by humans (see Mladenoff et al. 1997). Minimum of 10,000-13,000 sq km (with low road density) might be necessary to support a viable population (USFWS 1990); a single pack does not constitute a ""minimum viable population"" (USFWS 1990). Young are born in an underground burrow that has been abandoned by another mammal or dug by wolf. In Northwest Territories, dens were most commonly located witin 50 km of northern tree line, which resulted in maximal availability of caribou during the denning and pup rearing period; within the tundra zone, dens were not preferentially located near caribou calving grounds (Heard and Williams 1992). In Minnesota, dens usually were not near territory boundaries; den use was traditional in most denning alpha females studied for more than 1 year; possibly the availability of a stable food supply source helped determine den location (Ciucci and Mech 1992)."
Vermivora bachmanii,"Suitable habitat for this habitat generalist includes upland and lowland forests, shrublands, and coastal prairies and marshes; areas with heavy vegetative cover. Young are born in a den in a hollow log, in a burrow, or in similar secluded sites."
Vermivora chrysoptera,"Beavers inhabit permanent sources of water of almost any type in their range, which extends from arctic North America to the Gulf of Mexico and arid Southwest, and from sea level to over 3400 m in the mountains. They prefer low gradient streams (which they modify), ponds, and small mud-bottomed lakes with dammable outlets (Slough and Sadleir 1977, Beier and Barrett 1987, Novak 1987a, McComb et al. 1990). Beavers readily occupy artificial ponds, reservoirs, and canals if food is available. They generally avoid lakes with strong wave action and fast- moving streams. Waters with greatly fluctuating flow or water levels generally are poor habitat. In larger rivers (9th order or larger streams), beavers use floodplains and backwaters. In the north, they require water that is deep enough such that it does not freeze to the bottom and allows the accumulation of a substantial food pile beneath the ice. Beavers are associated with deciduous tree and shrub communities. In many situations beavers modify existing stream courses or other bodies of water and make them more suitable for their own use (see section below on dam building). They may occupy deep sections of streams and existing lakes or ponds without constructing a dam. <br><br>See Allen (1983) for a beaver habitat suitability index based on food and water characteristics. See Novak (1987a) for references to other models that have been developed in attempts to predict beaver family density. <br><br>Dam Construction Most dam building occurs April-June and especially August-October (Hill 1982), though repairs may be made at any time. In Quebec, the density of dams on small streams (4th order or less) averaged 10.6 per kilometer (range 8.6-16.0) (Naiman et al. 1986). In the northeastern U.S., a beaver family maintains an average of 2.5 dams. Generally trees, together with mud and rocks, supply the material for a dam. <br><br>Streams dammed by beavers typically are 2nd to 4th order streams; rarely do they build on 1st-order streams except at uncommonly high population densities. Dams in the main channel of streams of 5th order or larger often are destroyed by spring flooding (Naiman et al. 1986). In some areas (e.g. Missouri), dam building does not occur as commonly as in the north or west, perhaps due to the occurrence of deep swift rivers subject to severe flooding (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981). <br><br>Lodges <br><br>A characteristic beaver sign is the lodge, a hollow mound of tree branches (or, in the far north, mainly nonwoody material) and mud within which the beaver family sleeps and raises young. A lodge may be built against a bank, on an island, or in shallow water, but it must be near permanently deep water such that the entrance of the lodge is under water and so that the food cache can be reached even when the body of water is ice-covered. In bogs in northern Minnesota, beavers sometimes built lodges on the bog mat and many lodges were floating (Rebertus 1986). allowing for some ventilation. A family may maintain and use more than one lodge in summer in some areas (e.g., Colorado, Massachusetts). In some localities beavers use a different lodge each winter; it is more likely that the same lodge will be used if food in the area is abundant (Buech 1985). Beaver dens are not always in lodges. In some areas, beavers den in burrows in the banks of streams or lakes. This is common in areas subject to floods and fluctuating water levels. Beavers normally stay within 0.8 km of the den throughout the year (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981)."
Vermivora cyanoptera,"Variable according to location. Uses open areas such as alpine pastures, marshy meadows, river flats, and aspen parkland, as well as coniferous forests, brushy clear cuts or forest edges, and semi-desert areas (Tule elk). <br /><br />No special calving ground is used; calves are born in valleys or in areas as high as alpine tundra. Newborn initially may be hidden in rough terrain or dense cover."
Vireo flavifrons,"Prefers cool, mesic deciduous, coniferous, or mixed forests, especially areas with large amount of ground cover. Regarded as an ecological indicator of old-growth conditions in the Rocky Mountains. Also uses second-growth areas. Mossy logs and tree roots in coniferous forests are optimal. In the northern part of its range also found in muskegs, sedge marshes, shrubby habitats, and treed peatlands (Merritt, in Wilson and Ruff 1999). Often on rock outcrops in some areas (e.g., Virginia). Often associated with abandoned stone walls (fences) in the northeastern U.S. In Pennsylvania, abundance increased with forest fragmentation (Yahner 1992). Nests under logs, stumps and roots. Unlike MICROUnrankable S, doesn't dig tunnels, but uses the burrows of moles and other small mammals."
Vireo gilvus,"Seldom far from bodies of water. Prefers wet soils in flood plains, swamps, meadows, and other openings near water. Good swimmer and diver. May be active in water under ice in winter. More dependent on water in winter when ground is frozen. Occasionally occurs in leaf mold on the floor of dense forests. Tunnels may be shallow or deep and may open at ground surface or under water. <br><br>Nest usually is placed in a hummock, under a stump or log, in humus among rotten tree roots, or in other areas above high water, often near a stream."
Vireo griseus,"This is a bat of forested regions. Hibernation in the north and in mountainous regions most often occurs in caves or similar sites; small caves are selected, and the bats stay near the entrance (often within 30 meters) and are thought to move about in winter (Handley 1959, Barbour and Davis 1969). In Kentucky, shallow caves or rock shelters in sandstone formations of the Cumberland Plateau often are used (MacGregor, pers. comm. 1992). Winter habitat in the south is poorly known, but usually this species is not found in caves during winter. In the Coastal Plain they are suspected to use hollow trees for cold weather and possibly winter roosts (Clark, pers. comm. 1992). In the southern portions of the range these bats often roost in buildings year round.<br /><br />Summer roosts often are in hollow trees (e.g., Gooding and Langford 2004, Trousdale and Beckett 2005) (occasionally under loose bark) or in abandoned buildings, under bridges, or in culverts, in or near wooded areas. In a bottomland hardwood forest in Kentucky, radio-tagged big-eared bats roosted almost exclusively in trees in forested wetlands (Johnson and Lacki 2013). In western Texas, several maternity colonies were in ""manufactured structures"" (Mirowsky et al. 2004). Nursery colonies are rare in caves but are known to occur in Kentucky and Tennessee (Barbour and Davis 1969). A sandstone cave in Kentucky served as both a maternity site and hibernaculum, though the bats used different portions of the cave in winter and summer (Hurst and Lacki 1999). A large nursery colony (87 adults in June of 1985) roosts in abandoned copper mines in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Currie, pers. comm. 1992).<br /><br />In Louisiana, Gooding and Langford (2004) found that roost trees were hollow <i>Nyssa aquatica</i> with triangular-shaped basal openings, and all were located within a 5-hectare tupelo stand. Similarly, in eastern Tennessee, roosts were primarily in large hollow <i>Nyssa aquatica</i> (Carver and Ashley 2008).In Mississippi, Trousdale and Beckett (2005) found that tree roosts were in hollow <i>Nyssa</i> spp. and <i>Magnolia grandiflora</i>. Roost trees in Georgia were mainly large hollow <i>Nyssa aquatica</i> (and a few other species) with smooth interior walls (Clement and Castleberry 2013a). Most of the trees were still alive, relatively large, and were adjacent to streams or other bodies of water. Tree roosts were apparently rare within the study area, and <i>C. rafinesquii</i> showed roost fidelity to particular areas of forest. Six tree roosts were used by multiple individuals and several trees were reused within tracking sessions and among years. Trees used for roosting usually are in thick stands and not exposed to direct sunlight (Clark et al. 1997, Carver and Ashley 2008).<br /><br />In Louisiana, Lance et al. (2001) demonstrated that bridges, especially girder bridges, are important day-roost sites. Tagged bats in this study roosted under bridges 50% of the time and in black gum trees (<i>Nyssa aquatica</i>) 50% of the time. In Mississippi, small groups of females (mean of 5.6 adult females) used concrete bridges as maternity roosts; the bridges were much less used in fall and winter (Trousdale and Beckett 2004). Wolters and Martin (2011) observed a maternity colony that formed during each of several years under a concrete bridge in west-central Mississippi. Girder bridges also are commonly used as summer day roosts in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina (Bennett et al. 2008). It has been suggested that the species began using man-made structures in the coastal plain region only after large old hollow trees became scarce (Currie 1992, Clark 1992).<br /><br />In Arkansas these bats are found in cisterns and wells rather than caves (Harvey 1992b). In the mountains of South Carolina they roost in rock houses, abandoned gold mines, and hollow trees (Strayer 1992b). In the coastal plain of North Carolina, they move into old buildings in the summer. They are known to use hollow trees as temporary night roosts between feeding bouts in the summer (Clark pers. comm. 1992). In central Florida, a maternity roost was in an abandoned trailer that had been placed on a site in the early 1980s; it had been occupied for several years by the mid-1990s (Finn 1996).<br /><br />Dilapidated buildings are inhabited more commonly than are intact occupied structures, and Clark (1987) and Strayer (1992) reported that these bats roost in the darkest parts of such buildings. Others have reported that these bats choose more open and lighted daytime roosts than other kinds of bats (Handley 1959, Barbour and Davis 1969, Harvey 1992). Clark (1987) agreed that in caves and mines this species prefers areas receiving some natural light.<br /><br />The foraging habitat is primarily mature forest in both upland and lowland areas. In North Carolina and Virginia, foraging habitat for subspecies <i>macrotis </i>included mature hardwood floodplain forest; sites along permanent water bodies, especially rivers, were preferred (Clark 1987). In the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, where large contiguous tracts of mature bottomland hardwoods were common, most foraging activity of males nevertheless occurred in young pine stands; only 9% of foraging areas were in bottomland hardwoods (Menzel et al. 2001). In southeastern Kentucky, radio-tagged individuals foraged along ridgelines supporting upland oak-hickory forest (Hurst and Lacki 1999). In Arkansas, captures tended to be in dry corridor sites rather than corridors over water (Medlin and Risch 2008). In Kentucky, deciduous forests on drier soils near forested wetlands were important foraging habitats for pregnant females (Johnson and Lacki 2013)."
Vireo olivaceus,"Generally occurs in open country with dense herbaceous vegetation. Also brushy areas, forest edges, and sometimes salt and freshwater marshes. Sometimes in scrubby live oak, pine-oak, dense humid tropical forest, and cloud forest, and near water in Mexico and Central America. Nest site may be underground or under log, stump, rock, board."
Vireo philadelphicus,"Often found in brushy, hilly areas near grassy meadows; prefers older forest interspersed with areas of grass; tolerates diverse habitats: mixed forest, broadleaf forest, subalpine vegetation, grassland, scrub, savanna (Feldhamer et al. 1988)."
Vireo solitarius,"Prefers brushy areas with loose soil; also common in pinelands and hardwood uplands. Individuals make several burrows, often placed at side of creek."
Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus,"Very adaptable; may be found in most habitats. Prefers wooded riparian habitats. Also in suburban areas. Abandoned burrows, buildings, hollow logs, and tree cavities are generally used for den sites. In southeastern New York, all weaning dens were in burrows; weaning dens were in more densely vegetated habitats than were nonweaning dens (Hossler et al. 1994)."
Zenaida macroura,"Habitats range from high mountains to low deserts, including cities. Summer roosts generally are in buildings, bridges, hollow trees, spaces behind exfoliating bark, rock crevices, tunnels, or cliff swallow nests, in sites that do not get too hot. Maternity colonies may form in attics, barns, rock crevices, or tree cavities. Most adult females return to the same maternity roost site in successive years. Caves, mines, and especially buildings and human-made structures are used for hibernation."
Zonotrichia albicollis,"In West, shrubby sagebrush plains and mountains, juniper woodland; ranges include grazing area, shelter, water, and shade (Slade and Godfrey 1982). Often on ridgetops."
Zonotrichia leucophrys,"Inhabits nearshore and offshore waters. Mainly coastal in the North Atlantic, occurs over the continental shelf in the North Pacific (Right Whale Recovery Team 1990). Tynan et al. (2001) found a few of the remaining North Pacific animals concentrated in relatively warm (10.4 C SST), shallow (50 to 80 m deep), well-stratified water in an extensive coccolithophore bloom of EMILIANIA HUXLEYI. Mother-calf pairs generally concentrate their summer feeding activities in relatively secluded areas away from sites frequented by other whales (Schaeff et al. 1993)."
Alligator mississippiensis,"Prefers the deep sandy soils of open areas. Absent from the silt loam soils of the Rio Grande Floodplain. Open areas of long-leaf pine woods, dry loose soils. Fossorial."
Caiman crocodilus,"Prefers deciduous and mixed forests, particularly beech- maple, oak-hickory and poplar. Also occurs in old orchards. In New Hampshire, preferentially used areas with large shagbark hickories and beeches; males tended to use areas with large oaks, females tended to use areas with abundant snags (Fridell and Litvaitis 1991). Favors small, abandoned woodpecker holes for den sites; also uses nest boxes and abandoned bird and squirrel nests outside tree cavities."
Balaenoptera borealis,"Usually offshore, but moves inshore when squid are spawning (e.g., in spring off southern California) (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Exhibits a relatively high degree of site fidelity, at least seasonally (see Stacey and Baird 1993)."
Balaenoptera physalus,"Stomach contents suggest mainly pelagic distribution, usually seaward of continental shelf; may also occur in coastal waters (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983)."
Bison bison,"Stomach contents from South Africa indicate that distribution may be centered along edge of continental shelf (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Adults may occupy deeper waters than do immatures. Dive to at least 300 meters (Birchler and Potter, in Wilson and Ruff 1999)."
Blarina brevicauda,"Habitat is primarily forested (frequently coniferous) areas adjacent to lakes, ponds, or streams, including areas that have been altered by humans. During migration, these bats sometimes occur in xeric areas. Summer roosts and nursery sites are in coniferous or deciduous tree foliage, cavities, or under loose bark, sometimes in buildings. In the Pacific Northwest and Black Hills (South Dakota), these bats show an affinity for forests that contain large numbers of snags (Campbell et al. 1996, Mattson et al. 1996, Betts 1998). In winter, individuals have been found in mines, caves, houses, rock crevices, under loose bark, and in hollow trees.<br /><br />In Oregon, maternity roosts were in cavities high in tall, declining or newly dead trees; roost fidelity of reproductive females varied among individuals: some bats used only 1 or 2 roosts from 8 to at least 13 days; others used 5 or 6 roosts from 1 to 6 days; radio-tagged bats that were in the same colony stayed together during shifts among roosts; bats moved 35 to 1,100 meters between successive roosts (Betts 1998). In South Dakota, maternity aggregations primarily were in woodpecker-created cavities in ponderosa pines (Mattson et al. 1996).<br /><br />At Long Point, Ontario, late summer/early fall migrants rats roosted in a variety of tree species and human-made structures in natural and developed (e.g., residential) areas (McGuire et al. 2012). In Manitoba, migrants roosted typically in narrow crevices in tree trunks (Barclay et al. 1988).<br /><br />In the Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas, Perry et al. (2010) radio-tracked 11 bats to 31 day-roosts during winter. Ninety percent of roosts were in trees (5 species): 55 percent of all all roosts were under loose bark of the bole of live overstory <i>Pinus echinata</i> (shortleaf pine), three percent of roosts were in a rock outcrop, and six percent were at ground level (under a tree root or in a cavity at the base of a live pine). Bats selected pine or pine-hardwood stands greater than 50 years old and used forest stands 15-50 years of age less than their availability. Most roosts were on southern topographic aspects, and bats roosted in the rock outcrop on colder days (&lt;5 ∞C).<br /><br />See Vonhof and Barclay (1996) for information on characteristics of roost trees in British Columbia. See Campbell et al. (1996) for roost characteristics in Washington."
Blarina carolinensis,"Habitat includes a wide range of forested and semi-forested areas (e.g. O'Keefe et al. 2009), including developed areas with large trees (e.g., city parks) and some areas subject to intensive forest management (e.g., Elmore et al. 2004). In summer, females tend to occur in warmer lowland regions whereas males are proportionally more common in cooler highlands (Ford et al. 2002). Spring/summer diurnal roosts usually are in foliage of numerous species of large hardwood trees (also pines in some areas; Elmore et al. 2004); suitable sites are open underneath to allow easy exit and entry. Individuals frequently switch roost sites in both summer and winter (Hutchinson and Lacki 2000, Mager and Nelson 2001, Mormann and Robbins 2007). Solitary females roost with young in tree foliage.<br /><br />In spring and summer in eastern Kentucky, eastern red bats roosted an average of 16.5 meters above ground in the outer foliage of the canopy of 13 species of large hardwood trees, at least 50 meters from forest edges (Hutchinson and Lacki 2000). Most roost trees were on ridge tops of upland forests.<br /><br />In an intensively managed pine landscape in Mississippi, red bats generally roosted diurnally in foraging areas, which usually contained a reliable water source and open canopy conditions (young open canopy stands, thinned stands, and riparian hardwood stands) (Elmore et al. 2005).<br /><br />In an urban-rural interface in Indiana, red bats foraged in woodlands and over newly planted tree fields, open water, and pasture lands more than predicted by randomly generated points and avoided highly urban areas such as commercial lands, gravel pits, and transportation corridors (Walters et al. 2007).<br /><br />In summer in an urban area in Illinois, red bats roosted usually in the foliage or on the bark of large deciduous trees, sometimes in leaf litter, dense grass, or shingles of houses (Mager and Nelson 2001).<br /><br />In southwestern Missouri, winter roosts were in eastern red-cedar or hardwoods, on the south side of trees, on south-facing slopes; bats switched from tree roosts to leaf litter roosts when ambient temperatures approached or fell below freezing (Mormann and Robbins 2007). Similar behavior has been recorded elsewhere (e.g., Rodrigue et al. 2001)."
Canis latrans,"Habitat includes primarily deciduous and coniferous forests and woodlands, including areas altered by humans. Foraging habitat includes various open areas, including spaces over water and along riparian corridors. Individuals may forage around lights in nonurban situations (Furlonger et al. 1987). Roost sites are usually in foliage of large deciduous or coniferous trees (e.g., Perry and Thill 2007), near the end of branches 3-19 meters above ground, with dense foliage above and open flying room below, often at the edge of a clearing and commonly in hedgerow trees. Sometimes these bats roost in rock crevices or other sites, rarely in caves. Individuals change roosts frequently and exhibit a low level of roost fidelity (Perry and Thill 2007). Solitary females with young roost among tree foliage; a female may use the same site for a few weeks (Perry and Thill 2007) and in successive years. In Saskatchewan, reproductive females roosted on the south (especially southeast) side of white spruce trees, where wind speed was reduced (Willis and Brigham 2005). Lactating females in Alberta selected roosts that offered shelter from wind and exposure to sunlight (Klug et al. 2012). Hibernating individuals have been found in various situations, such as on tree trunks, in a tree cavity, in a squirrel's nest, and in a clump of Spanish-moss."
Canis lupus,"These bats occur in various wooded habitats in the vicinity of permanent water. In the southeastern U.S., they often roost and rear young a few to more than 10 meters above ground in clumps of Spanish-moss, commonly in stands of mature live oaks, longleaf pine/turkey oak sandhill habitats, or loblolly/slash pine stands (Sherman 1945, Jennings 1958, Kern 1992, Krishon et al. 1997, Menzel et al. 1999, Hutchinson 2006, Carter and Menzel 2007). In some areas, such as southern Texas, they roost and rear young in the skirt of old fronds of tall palm trees or structurally similar sites (Chapman and Chapman 1990, Mirowsky 1997, Ammerman et al. 2012). In Veracruz (Mexico), a large group of females and juveniles roosted among dried corn stalks hanging on the sides of a building (Baker and Dickerman 1956). Northern yellow bats rarely roost in buildings or other human-made structures. Foraging habitat is primarily open areas such as fields, pastures, airports, golf courses, marshes, lake borders, and the open savanna-like habitat of sandhills (Jennings 1958, Kern 1992); also forest edges and spaces above trees. These bat often are taken in mist nets set over water."
Canis rufus,"Habitats include pine, mixed pine-hardwood, and hardwood forests of uplands and bottomlands, particularly pine-dominated forests, including mature pine and pine-hardwood corridors in managed pine forest landscapes (Menzel et al. 1998, 1999, 2000; Carter et al. 2004; Marks and Marks 2006; Perry and Thill 2007; Perry et al. 2007; Hein et al. 2008; Ammerman et al. 2012). Foraging occurs over water, clearings, and woods, including pine stands and upland and bottomland hardwoods (Carter et al. 2004). During autumn through spring, these bats commonly can be found in and near forests that support clumps of Spanish-moss (Jennings 1958). Roosts are up to 19 meters above ground in tall, large-diameter trees, but seasonally the bats may roost near or on the forest floor. In summer, roosts include clumps of needles on small branches in the canopy of large pines (often slash pine or loblolly pines; roosting bats may resemble pine cones) (Menzel et al. 1998, 1999, 2000; Perry and Thill 2007; Perry et al. 2007; Hein et al. 2008). Sometimes the bats have been found in clumps of Spanish-moss (mainly autumn through spring) (Constantine 1958, Jennings 1958). Winter roosts of adult males in South Carolina were in the canopy of overstory trees, understory vegetation, pine needle clusters, and leaf litter; bats roosted near or on the forest floor during cold weather, sometimes staying in one roost for up to 12 consecutive days (Hein et al. 2005, 2008). Individuals often switch among roosts in close proximity but may return to previously used trees or roost sites (Menzel et al. 2000, Perry and Thill 2007, Hein et al. 2008)."
Castor canadensis,"Streams, lakes, ponds, swamps, marshes, estuaries (in some areas), beaver flowages, exposed outer coast (Pacific Northwest, Alaska). When inactive, occupies hollow log, space under roots, log, or overhang, abandoned beaver lodge, dense thicket near water, or burrow of other animal; such sites also are used for rearing young. Highly associated with beaver on Mount Desert Island, Maine (Dubuc et al. 1990). Uses traditional haul-out sites along the banks of aquatic habitats. May travel long distances overland, particularly in snow."
Cervus elaphus,"Various habitats including deciduous-coniferous woodlands and forest edge, hardwood forests, swamps, forested river bottomlands, brushlands, deserts, mountains, and other areas with thick undergrowth. Large tracts of habitat are most favorable. Primarily terrestrial. When inactive, occupies rocky cleft, cave, hollow log, space under fallen tree, etc.; usually changes shelter daily. Young are born in a den in a hollow log, under a fallen tree, in a rock shelter, or similar site."
Clethrionomys gapperi,"Woodchucks live in open habitats (meadows, pastures, old fields, orchards) that often border wooded areas, which may be used for hibernation (Caire et al. 1989, Kwiecinski 1998). In Connecticut, burrow systems were often along woodland edges and brushy fence rows (Swihart 1992). Young are born in a den in an extensive burrow system."
Condylura cristata,"Habitat includes the open ocean and coastal waters, sometimes including inshore areas such as bays. Summer distribution is in temperate and subpolar waters. In winter, most humpbacks are in tropical/subtropical waters near islands or coasts.<br><br>In the western North Atlantic, humpbacks give birth mainly over shallow wide banks near islands. In Hawaii, they concentrate over shallower waters near islands (Tomich 1986); groups including a calf tend to occur in shallower waters than do groups lacking a calf (Smultea 1994)."
Condylura cristata parva,"Prefers semi-open country with woodland and meadows interspersed, brushy areas, bottomland woods. Frequently found in suburban areas. Dens often under rocks, log, or building. May excavate burrow or use burrow abandoned by other mammal."
Corynorhinus rafinesquii,Open ocean; typical habitat is believed to be farther offshore than that of any other member of the genus.
Cryptotis parva,Presumably mainly pelagic; known primarily from strandings.
Dama dama,"Found in a wide variety of habitats from dry pastures and wooded swamps to marshes and orchards. Needs loose organic soils for tunneling. Builds extensive underground tunnels. Nests in these tunnels under rocks or logs, and in self-constructed grassy clumps."
Dasypus novemcinctus,"Lives in a wide variety of habitats, but in many areas prefers upland wooded areas with a thick layer of loose soil and humus. Can be numerous in orchards and nurseries with ample ground vegetation that provides protective cover. Spends most of time underground in shallow burrow systems. Young are born in nests built beneath logs, below surface litter, or underground."
Didelphis virginiana,"Occupies buildings/other structures, as well as natural habitats such as fields, cropland, and (in Hawaii) low elevation forests, beaches, sometimes high elevation forest and scrub (Tomich 1986, Sugihara 1997). In some areas, movement into buildings coincides with the onset of cold weather in late fall. Young are born in a nest that may be communally constructed in a well-concealed site."
Eptesicus fuscus,"Habitat varies geographically and includes open forests, farmlands and cultivated areas, grassy fields and meadows, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, alpine meadows, scrub, steppe and semi-deserts, prairies, coastal dunes, and sometimes rural residential areas; snow cover is not an obstacle; generally avoids deep dense forest and sandy desert. When inactive, occupies burrow made by vole or mole, or rests in nest in hole in wall of building or under corn shock or similar site. Den site may change often. Young are born in abandoned underground burrows made by other mammals (or similar secluded sites)."
Equus caballus,"Prefers freshwater marshes; also in brackish marshes. Nests in burrows, abandoned muskrat houses, or in dense vegetation."
Eubalaena glacialis,"Roosts are primarily in caves in regions where suitable caves are available; suitable caves may or may not contain water. Otherwise, roosts are in hollows of bottomland hardwood trees (often with triangular basal openings) or in structures such as abandoned buildings, bridges, culverts, or bat houses. The key characteristics for maternity sites are high humidity and constant warm temperatures. Roost sites, whether in caves or trees, often are over water. Foraging habitat consists of areas over water bodies, riparian floodplain forests, flatwoods, or wooded wetlands with permanent open water nearby (MacGregor 1992, Gardner et al. 1992, Humphrey and Gore 1992). Upon departing from their diurnal roosts, these bats fly to water to drink and forage over lakes, ponds, or slow-moving streams.<br /><br />In Florida, large numbers form maternity colonies in caves, with smaller colonies in tree hollows, buildings or other structures (Marks and Marks 2006). Maternity colonies also have been found in a small number of caves in Georgia and Alabama. In the rest of the southern and central parts of the range, these bats generally use buildings and other structures, mines, and large hollow trees (e.g., water tupelo, black gum, water hickory, bald cypress) for spring and summer roosts (e.g., Gooding and Langford 2004, Mirowsky et al. 2004, Carver and Ashley 2008, Fleming et al. 2013). In Louisiana, a hollow water tupelo (<i>Nyssa aquatica</i>) studied in late summer and early fall contained about 50 individuals (Gooding and Langford 2003). By winter in this region these bats roost in small groups in outdoor sites, often over water, such as bridges, culverts, storm sewers, and boat houses, as well as in hollow trees (Barbour and Davis 1969). In Florida (and perhaps elsewhere), the bats also roost in caves in winter; apparently they may use different caves for summer and winter roosts (Humphrey and Gore 1992, Gore 1992); winter roosts also include various structures (Marks and Marks 2006). In Georgia, roosts were in cypress-gum swamps in summer, but bats switched to a diverse hardwood floodplain forest with shallower flood waters in winter; the change was attributed to winter flooding of tree hollows used in summer (Clement and Castleberry 2013). Winter roosts in Texas include bottomland tree hollows and concrete culverts (Mirowsky et al. 2004, Ammerman et al. 2012).<br /><br />In the north, the pattern of cave use is different. Kentucky populations winter in caves (often with <i>Myotis sodalis</i>) but are rare in most caves in the summer, when most roost in large hollow trees (MacGregor 1992). However, one large maternity colony in a Kentucky cave has been reported (MacGregor 1992). The few old records from Indiana also were mostly from caves in winter. Summer roost sites are poorly known from this part of their range. At least one cave in Indiana had bats every month except May, June, and July (Mumford and Whitaker 1982). Only a few maternity colonies have been reported in this region: one was in the Kentucky cave already mentioned; additional maternity colonies exist in southern Illinois, where one was in a hollow-based water tupelo (<i>Nyssa aquatica</i>) (Hofmann et al. 1999)."
Geomys pinetis,"Roost sites are nearly exclusively restricted to caves throughout the year (Hall and Wilson 1966, Barbour and Davis 1969, Tuttle 1976), though only a few percent of available caves are suitable (Tuttle 1979). Winter roosts are in deep vertical caves with domed halls. Large summer colonies utilize caves that trap warm air and provide restricted rooms or domed ceilings; maternity caves often have a stream flowing through them and are separate from the caves used in summer by males. <br /><br />Occasionally non-cave roost sites are used. Hays and Bingman (1964) reported a colony in a storm sewer in Pittsburg, Kansas and, in 1988, a maternity colony was discovered using a storm sewer in Kansas (Decher and Choate 1988). Harvey and McDaniel (1988) located a maternity colony in a storm sewer in downtown Newark, Independence County, Arkansas. There are occasional reports of mines (Sealander 1979, Thom 1981, Brack et al. 1984, Harvey 1988) and buildings (Gunier and Elder 1971) being used as roost sites. <br /><br />Winter caves are deep and vertical and provide a large volume of air below the lowest entrance that acts as a cold air trap (Tuttle 1976). Cold air flows in and is trapped during successive winters, providing mean annual temperatures 6 degrees C or more below the above-ground mean annual temperature (Tuttle 1978). Hibernation sites often have multiple entrances, good air flow (Martin 2007), and temperatures of  approximately 5-9 C, though 1-4 C may be preferred (Tuttle and Kennedy 2005).<br /><br />In the summer, maternity colonies prefer caves that act as warm air traps or that provide restricted rooms or domed ceilings that are capable of trapping the combined body heat from thousands of clustered individuals (Tuttle 1975, Tuttle and Stevenson 1977). Cave temperatures range from 14 to 24 C. Undisturbed summer colonies may contain up to 250,000 bats, and average 10,000 to 25,000 (Tuttle 1979). Summer caves are nearly always located within 1 km of a river or reservoir over which the bats forage (Tuttle 1979). <br /><br />Tuttle (1979) showed that forested areas along the banks of streams and lakes provide important protection for adults and young. Young often feed and take shelter in forest areas near the entrance to cave roosts (Tuttle 1979). Do not feed in areas along rivers or reservoirs where the forest has been cleared (LaVal et al. 1977; Tuttle and Stevenson, in prep.). <br /><br />Yearlings and adult males segregate into nomadic summer colonies that tend to roost in caves within a few kilometers of ones selected by adult females (Layne 1978)."
Geomys pinetis cumberlandius,"Habitat is mostly hilly or mountainous, generally in or near deciduous or coniferous forest. Like many other bat species, this one often forages over ponds and streams; foraging habitat also includes riparian forests, upland forests, clearings, stripmines, and ridgetops (see USFWS 2013). Foraging flights tend to be slow and often within a few meters of the ground or water surface (Davis et al. 1965; Brack et al., unpublished, cited by USFWS 2013).<br /><br />Warm-season roosts may be primarily in cracks or crevices of rocky outcrops or talus slopes but also have been found in buildings (including the slate roof of a house), bridges (e.g., in expansion joints, guardrail crevices), towers, hollow trees, spaces beneath the loose bark of trees, road cuts, rocky dams, caves, and mines (Tuttle 1964, Barbour and Davis 1969, Best and Jennings 1997, Roble 2004, Johnson and Gates 2008, Johnson et al. 2011, O'Keefe and LaVoie 2011, USFWS 2013, Whitby et al. 2013). The species relies heavily on rock roosts or similar man-made structures during the summer months (Erdle and Hobson 2001, Johnson et al. 2011). Roosts often are exposed to the sun but also may be under moderate to extensive canopy cover (Johnson et al. 2011, Thomson and O'Keefe 2012). Recaptures of marked individuals in successive years indicate that the bats exhibit fidelity to their summer roosts (see USFWS 2013).<br /><br />In West Virginia, <i>M. leibii</i> used primarily ground-level rock roosts in talus slopes and rock fields, and sometimes roosted in vertical cliff faces; males and females frequently switched roosts (Johnson et al. 2011). Ground-level roosts had low canopy cover but were located close to vegetation. Ground-level roosts generally were a few hundred meters from ephemeral water sources; roosts used by females were closer to ephemeral water sources than were those used by males.<br /><br />In Tennessee, two individuals found in April were under a large flat rock at the edge of a quarry surrounded by woods and cow pastures (Tuttle 1964). In late July and early August in southern Illinois, many individuals, including post-lactating females and juveniles were found under loose rocks on exposed rock outcrops (Whitby et al. 2013). In Ontario, about 12 of these bats were found in July behind the door of a shed that was kept open (i.e., positioned against the wall) (Hitchcock 1955). These bats have been seen resting in limestone caves in West Virginia in spring and summer (Krutzsch 1966).<br /><br />By far most records come from observations of bats hibernating in winter in caves and mine tunnels. Hibernation occurs in solution and fissure caves and mine tunnels (including coal, iron, copper, and talc mines). Dunn and Hall (1989) noted that 52 percent of Pennsylvania hibernacula were small caves of less than 150 meters (500 feet) in length. Situations near the entrance where the air is relatively cold and dry seem to be preferred (Barbour and Davis 1969), though sometimes deeper locations are used (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981). Roost sites often are deep in crevices, or under rocks or in crevices on the cave floor, where the bats can be very difficult to find (Davis 1955, Krutzsch 1966, Martin et al. 1966). These bats are usually found singly or occasionally in small clusters, but many may be packed in a crevice; often they hang among other species (Marin et al. 1966). Individuals exhibit a high degree of fidelity to hibernacula and can be found in the same site in multiple years (Gates et al. 1984)."
Geomys pinetis fontanelus,"These bats use a wide range of habitats and often use human-made structures for resting and maternity sites; they also use caves and hollow trees. Foraging habitat requirements are generalized; foraging occurs over water, along the margins of lakes and streams, or in woodlands near water. Winter hibernation sites (caves, tunnels, abandoned mines, and similar sites) generally have a relatively stable temperature of about 2-12 C (see Kunz and Reichard 2010). Maternity colonies commonly are in warm sites in buildings (e.g., attics) and other structures; also infrequently in hollow trees. Microclimate conditions suitable for raising young are relatively narrow, and availability of suitable maternity sites may limit the species' abundance and distribution."
Glaucomys volans,"This bat generally is associated with old-growth forests composed of trees 100 years old or older. It relies on intact interior forest habitat, with low edge-to-interior ratios. Relevant late-successional forest features include a high percentage of old trees, uneven forest structure (resulting in multilayered vertical structure), single and multiple tree-fall gaps, standing snags, and woody debris. These late successional forest characteristics may be favored for several reasons, including the large number of partially dead or decaying trees that the species uses for breeding, summer day roosting, and foraging. [Source: USFWS 2011, which see for citations of further literature]<br /><br />Small, highly fragmented, or young forests that provide limited areas of subcanopy foraging habitat may not be suitable. Young forests may also lack appropriate nursery sites. However, recent studies indicate that these bats can exploit relatively isolated and small forest fragments (Caceres and Barclay 2000, Henderson et al. 2008, Johnson et al. 2008).<br /><br />Foraging occurs within forests, along forest edges, over forest clearings, and occasionally over ponds (Ammerman et al. 2012). Eleven individuals (10 males, 1 female) tagged with chemical lights observed during the summer in Missouri (LaVal et al. 1977), foraged almost exclusively among the trees of hillside and ridge forests, rather than utilizing floodplain and riparian forests; frequently foraging occurred within 1 to 3 m of the ground. Foraging bats doubled back frequently and only slowly moved out of the observation area. In Iowa, Kunz (1973, 1971) found primarily females foraging in mature deciduous uplands with adjacent deep ravines and in a disturbed riparian area with an adjacent floodplain and agricultural lands.<br /><br />Hibernation occurs primarily in caves, mines, and tunnels, typically those with large passages and entrances, relatively constant and cool temperatures, high humidity, and no air currents (Griffin 1940, Jackson 1961, Mumford and Cope 1964, Kurta 1982, Raesly and Gates 1987, Caceres and Pybus 1997, USFWS 2013). Hibernators frequently roost in crevices, drill holes, and similar sites (Griffin 1940, Layne 1958, Pearson 1962, Caire et al. 1979, Whitaker and Mumford 2009) where they may be overlooked during surveys, but roosting in the open is not uncommon (Barbour and Davis 1969, Whitaker and Mumford 2009). A lack of suitable hibernacula may prevent occupancy of areas that otherwise have adequate habitat (Kurta 1982).<br /><br />Use of different types of hibernacula can vary considerably among areas, depending upon quality and availability of sites. In a study of 71 potential hibernation sites, including large and small caves, overhangs, and mines, on the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois (Whitaker and Winter 1977), mines were the only occupied habitat. Mines also are the principal hibernation sites in northern Michigan where there are no caves (Stones 1981). In the northeastern U.S., hibernation sites include mines and caves (Griffin 1940, Hall et al. 1957) as well as large, cavelike water conduit tunnels (G. Hammerson, pers. obs.; T. French, cited by USFWS 2013).<br /><br />The principal requirements of a suitable hibernation site are winter-long, low temperatures above freezing, high humidity, and lack of disturbances, both natural (floods) and anthropogenic (visitation) (Barbour and Davis 1969, Hitchcock 1949). At least two studies have provided contradictory information on thermal habitat preferences, suggesting that warmer temperatures sometimes are selected or at least tolerated. In Illinois, Pearson (1962) found that the mean temperature at hibernation sites averaged 9.7 C. Stones (1981) studied the occurrence of bats in northern Michigan mines that were vertically thermally stratified. The mean ambient temperature was 5.9 C, with 43% of the population occurring in the range 7-8 C and 6.5% occurring in the range 9-11 C.<br /><br />There appears to be a high degree of philopatry in hibernaculum use. In Missouri, over 90% of recaptured banded individuals, representing 5% of the original banded population of 945 (753 males and 192 females), were recaptured at their cave of origin (Caire et al. 1979). Mills (1971) recaptured 4.8% of 358 individuals at their cave of origin the year after banding. Griffin (1945) found that of over 13,000 banded bats of various species, of which about 8,500 were banded in their winter hibernacula, the ratio was 100:1 for bats that were observed to return to their cave of origin over subsequent winters vs. those that were recaptured elsewhere.<br /><br />Night roosts used in summer between foraging bouts are in different habitats than day roosts. Caves, mines, and quarry tunnels are used as night roosts, typically by males, but also by nonreproductive females (Clark et al. 1987, Jones et al. 1967). They are joined later in the summer by juveniles and post-lactating females (Kunz, 1973). During the day, these same sites usually house no <i>M. septentrionalis</i>. Daytime observations typically are of individuals in crevices or hollows or under loose bark on trees (Foster and Kurta 1999) and in a variety of small spaces associated with buildings and other structures (Hoffmeister 1989, Caire et al. 1979, Hamilton and Whitaker 1979, Barbour and Davis 1969). At times <i>M. septentrionalis</i> has been found in or around caves on summer nights, but not actually roosting in them (Mills 1971). Early in the summer, these groups mostly comprise males, with females and young-of-the-year joining later in the season (Caire et al. 1979).<br /><br />Nothing has been published on the fidelity of individuals or colonies to particular swarming sites, nor the relationship of swarming site selection to hibernaculum and summer roost selection. Given the low numbers found in most hibernacula and summer night roosts relative to the higher numbers found at swarming sites, it appears that certain caves serve as congregation points for fall mating activity. However, short-term banding returns at swarming sites are very low, indicating movement among swarming sites (Kurta, pers. comm.).<br /><br />Most nursery colonies are in cavities or beneath loose bark in trees or snags in upland forests, with roost entrances generally below or within the tree canopy (Mumford and Cope 1964, Sasse and Perkins 1996, Lacki and Schwierjohann 2001, Menzel et al. 2002, Owen et al. 2002, Carter and Feldhamer 2005, Perry and Thill 2007, Lacki et al. 2009, Timpone et al. 2010, Silvis et al. 2012). Reproductive females use a wide range of tree species. For example, in summer in north-central Kentucky, Silvis et al. (2012) tracked 58 females to 105 roost trees of 21 species; sassafras was used as a day roost more than expected based on forest stand-level availability and accounted for 48.6 percent of all observed day roosts. Individuals frequently switch roosts (Menzel et al. 2002, Owen et al. 2002, Carter and Feldhamer 2005, Timpone et al. 2010).<br /><br />Some summer roosts are in buildings or bat houses or under bridges (Brandon 1961, Barbour and Davis 1969, Cope and Humphrey 1972, Amelon and Burhans 2006, Whitaker and Mumford 2009). A large colony in a barn in Indiana (Cope and Humphrey 1972) on 22 June had 24 adult females, 12 immature females, and 18 immature males; 10 other adults escaped. Of the 24 females, 23 were lactating and 1 was pregnant. Roosts of males and nonreproductive females include tree hollows as well as cooler locations, including caves and mines (Barbour and Davis 1969, Amelon and Burhans 2006). In Arkansas, pine snags were important summer roosts for males (Perry and Thill 2007).<br /><br />In West Virginia, these bats formed social groups whose roost areas and roost tree networks overlapped to some extent (Johnson et al. 2012). Most networks had a single central node roost tree. In control treatments, central node roost trees were in early stages of decay and surrounded by greater basal area than other trees within the networks. In prescribed fire treatments, central node roost trees were small in diameter, low in the forest canopy, and surrounded by low basal area compared to other trees in networks. The results indicated that forest disturbances, including prescribed fire, can affect availability and distribution of roosts within roost tree networks."
Globicephala macrorhynchus,"<i>Myotis sodalis</i> hibernates primarily in caves (about 70 percent of population), also in mines and in one dam and one tunnel (USFWS 2009). Maternity sites generally are behind loose bark of dead or dying trees or in tree cavities (Menzel et al. 2001). Foraging habitats include riparian areas, upland forests, ponds, and fields (Menzel et al. 2001), but forested landscapes are the most important habitat in agricultural landscapes (Menzel et al. 2005).<br /><br />In hibernation, limestone caves with pools are preferred. Hall (1962) noted that preferred caves are of medium size with large, shallow passageways. Roosts usually are in the coldest part of the cave. Preferred sites have a mean midwinter air temperature of 4-8 C (tolerates much broader range) (Hall 1962, Henshaw and Folk 1966), well below that of caves that are not chosen (Clawson et al. 1980). Roost sites within caves may shift such that bats remain in the coldest area (Clawson et al. 1980); individuals may move from a location deeper in the cave to a site nearer the entrance as the cold season progresses; they may move away from areas that go below freezing. Hibernation in the coldest parts of the cave ensures a sufficiently low metabolic rate so that the fat reserves last through the six-month hibernation period (Henshaw and Folk 1966, Humphrey 1978). Relative humidity in occupied caves ranges from 66 to 95% and averages 87% throughout the year (Barbour and Davis 1969, Clawson et al. 1980). Because of these requirements, <i>M. sodalis</i> is highly selective of hibernacula.<br /><br />During the fall, when these bats swarm and mate at their hibernacula, males roost in trees nearby during the day and fly to the cave during the night. In Kentucky, Kiser and Elliott (1996) found males roosting primarily in dead trees on upper slopes and ridgetops within 2.4 km of their hibernaculum. During September in West Virginia, males roosted within 5.6 km in trees near ridgetops, and often switched roost trees from day to day (C. Stihler, West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, pers. obs., October 1996, cited in USFWS 1999). Fall roost trees tend to be in sunnier areas rather than being shaded (J. MacGregor, pers. obs., October 1996, cited in USFWS 1999).<br /><br />In summer, habitat consists of wooded or semi-wooded areas, often but not always along streams. Solitary females or small maternity colonies bear their offspring in hollow trees or under loose bark of living or dead trees (Humphrey et al. 1977, Garner and Gardner 1992). Known roost tree species include elm, oak, beech, hickory, maple, ash, sassafras, birch, sycamore, locust, aspen, cottonwood, pine, and hemlock (Cope et al. 1974, Humphrey et al. 1977, Garner and Gardner 1992, Britzke et al. 2003, Britzke et al. 2006).<br /><br />Humphrey et al. (1977) determined that dead trees are preferred roost sites and that trees standing in sunny openings are attractive because the air spaces and crevices under the bark are warmer. In Illinois, Garner and Gardner (1992) found that typical roosts were beneath the exfoliating bark of dead trees; other roost sites were beneath the bark of living trees and in cavities of dead trees. Kurta et al. (1993) found a large maternity colony in a dead, hollow, barkless, unshaded sycamore tree in a pasture in Illinois. In Michigan, a reproductively active colony occupied eight different roost trees (all green ash), all of which were exposed to direct sunlight throughout the day; bats roosted beneath loose bark of dead trees (Kurta et al. 1993). In western Virginia, a male used a mature, live, shagbark hickory tree as a diurnal roost; the bat foraged primarily among tree canopies of an 80-year-old oak-hickory forest (Hobson and Holland 1995). In Missouri, primary maternity roosts were in standing dead trees exposed to direct sunlight; there were 1-3 primary roosts per colony; alternate roosts were in living and dead trees that typically were within the shaded forest interior (Callahan et al. 1997). In eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, several maternity colonies were in sun-exposed conifer snags (roost sites were above the surrounding canopy); some of these snags fell and were not used in subsequent years (Britzke et al. 2003). Rarely maternity colonies have been found in crevices in utility poles or in bat boxes (e.g., Ritzi et al. 2005). See Menzel et al. (2001) for a review of forest habitat relationships.<br /><br />Though maternity sites have been reported as occurring mainly in riparian and floodplain forests (Humphrey et al. 1977, Garner and Gardner 1992), recent studies indicate that upland habitats are used by maternity colonies much more extensively than previously reported. Garner and Gardner (1992) reported that 38 of 51 roost trees in Illinois occurred in uplands and 13 trees were in floodplains. Of the 47 trees in forested habitat, 27 were in areas having a closed (80-100%) canopy, and 15 were in areas having an intermediate (30-80%) canopy. A single roost tree was found in the following types of habitat: a heavily grazed ridgetop pasture with a few scattered dead trees, a partially wooded swine feedlot, a palustrine wetland with emergent vegetation, a forested island in the Mississippi river, and a clearcut around a segment of an intermittent stream where dead trees were retained for wildlife. Roosts were not found in forests with open canopies (10-30%) or in old fields with less than or equal to 10% canopy cover.<br /><br />In Illinois, Indiana bats used the same, evidently traditional, roost sites in successive summers. Recapture of the same individuals within traditional roost sites during subsequent summers suggests site fidelity (Garner and Gardner 1992, Gardner et al. 1996).<br /><br />Relatively few individuals roost in caves at the mouths of which late summer swarming occurs (Cope and Humphrey 1977, Barbour and Davis 1969)."
Kogia breviceps,"Prefers deciduous and coniferous forests with herbaceous groundcover. Also occurs in brushlands. Nests in underground burrow (winter) or in log, stump, or under other cover."
Kogia sima,"Round-tailed muskrats require access to water. Typically they occur in shallow grassy salt/freshwater marshes. In Florida, dense stands of maidencane (<i>Panicum hemitomon</i>) and pickerelweed (<i>Pontederia lanceolata</i>) provide preferred habitat (Layne 1978); other habitats include salt marshes on Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and on Cape Sable (status in salt marshes on the northern Gulf coast needs further study). Pocosins and Carolina bays (Sharitz and Gibbons 1982) provide ideal habitat (Bergstrom). At Grand Bay, Georgia, round-tailed muskrats inhabit floating mats of boglike vegetation surrounded by open-water emergent marsh dominated by sedges such as <i>Carex </i>and <i>Eleocharis </i>spp.; these finer sedges are preferred house-building materials, whereas the coarser grass <i>Panicum </i>is preferred in Florida. The species is most abundant in areas with water 6-18 inches deep and a sandy, peaty, or soft substrate deep enough to allow burrowing to water during dry periods (Birkenholz 1972, Porter 1953).<br /><br />Dome-shaped houses, used for shelter and rearing young, are built among emergent vegetation; most house repair and new construction occur in spring. In south-central Georgia, houses are attached to the surfaces of floating mats of <i>Sphagnum </i>and organic muck or to the bases of shrubs or small trees (Baker 1889; Chapman 1889; Harper 1920, 1927; Birkenholtz 1963, Tilmant 1975). In sugarcane fields, houses, if present, are smaller and more rudimentary. Round-tailed muskrats also build extensive tunnel systems in drained muck soils of sugarcane fields and agricultural areas. <br /><br />These muskrats construct floating feeding stands near house sites. In Georgia, denuded areas usually close to the edge of the mat were used as feeding stations. <br /><br />Round-tailed muskrats are able to disperse between areas of suitable habitat across roads and small expanses of upland habitat and via ditches (Birkenholz 1963)."
Lasionycteris noctivagans,"Found in a wide variety of habitats, usually near water. Favored habitats include brushland and open woodlands, field edges, riparian grasslands, swamps, and marshes (Sheffield, in Wilson and Ruff 1999). Dens are in abandoned burrow made by other mammal, rock crevice, brushpile, stump hollow, or space among tree roots; one individual may use multiple dens. Tolerant of close proximity to humans."
Lasiurus borealis,"Favors forested, permanent or semipermanent wetlands with abundant cover, marshes, and riparian zones Dens in muskrat burrow, abandoned beaver den, hollow log, hole under tree roots, or in burrow dug by mink in streambank."
Lasiurus cinereus,"Wooded areas, ravines, floodplain forest; swamps and osage orange and other hedges in some areas in southern U.S. The coastal subspecies has been found in a wide variety of habitats, including lowland deciduous forests from Florida northward to southeastern North Carolina, generally inside or near edges of forests, primarily deciduous forest. Other habitats include low, wet areas, ranging from marshes (Svihla and Svihla 1933) to swamps and swamp hammocks (Bangs 1898, Harper 1927, Chamberlain 1928, Hamilton 1953). In Georgia and Florida, habitat is wet areas in hammocks and densely vegetated swamps, where nests are built in hollow trees or along stream banks in dense tangles of cabbage palmetto (Golley 1962, Hamilton and Whittaker 1979). Pearson (1952) recorded greatest abundance in ecotones between dry and wet hammocks in Florida. Harper (1927) described habitat in the Okefenokee Swamp as cypress bays, hammocks, swamps, and sometimes sphagnaceous bogs. <br><br>David Webster (UNC-Wilmington) suggested that the species is habitat-specific and confined to particular soil types. Preferred habitat in North Carolina consists of low-lying deciduous forests with a dense cover of palmetto (SABAL MINOR). The Rocky Point, Pender County, population is restricted to an unusual woodland dominated by dense shrub layer of SABAL MAJOR established on a unique soil (Pender Series) with a very shallow, acidic A-horizon and a slightly alkaline B-horizon (Webster et al. 1987). The habitat there appears to be similar to the palmetto forests of Florida where woodrats are relatively abundant. <br><br>Young are born in a nest in a rocky crevice, in or under a tree, in a brush pile, in an abandoned building (Schwartz and Odum 1957), or in a similar site; rarely in the lower branches of a tree. In the Midwest nests generally are sheltered by a stick house (Hayes and Harrison 1992). Nest commonly is used in successive years, may become quite large. Harper (1927) described a nest of sticks and other debris that filled a hollow cypress stump and rose to a height of three feet. Chamberlain (1928) described South Carolina nests that were two feet in height and three feet in diameter and constructed in tangles of grape and SMILAX. Golley (1962) wrote that nests are often supported by a log, constructed in a stump or hollow, or even several feet off the ground in vine tangles. Working in Gulf Coast Florida, Pearson (1952) described nests in barns, hollow logs, and subterranean chambers under stumps, tree bases, and root masses. Nest sites were not excavated to any extent by the rats themselves. The majority of nests described by Pearson were found in dense tangles of low shrubs with only small midden heaps scattered around them. Schwartz and Schwartz (1981) described typical woodrat nests as being large, 1.5 to 4 ft in diameter and > 3 ft in height. The internal nest cavity was typically 5-8 inches in diameter and carefully lined with finely shredded bark, leaves or grass. The exterior was a jumbled mass of sticks, dried grass, leaves, and assorted rubbish (old bones, pieces of metal, small rocks, etc.) collected by the rat. Nests were left open at the top in sheltered areas, but were roofed over in exposed situations such as in low trees and shrubs. Nests were used all year and, in some cases, for an entire lifetime. Woodrats continually added to their nests and established nests might have several levels and nest cavities."
Lasiurus intermedius,"These bats occur in deciduous, mixed deciduous-coniferous, and pine-dominated forests (including managed stands), which may be interspersed with cultivated areas, and they are commonly found along waterways (Schmidly et al. 1977, Schmidly 1991, Menzel et al. 2001, Miles et al. 2006, Perry and Thill 2008, Hein et al. 2009). Foraging occurs in open areas and around tree canopies. Habitats and roost-tree characteristics vary geographically and seasonally (Boyles and Robbins 2006). Males tend to roost solitarily; females form nursery colonies in summer, usually in trees or buildings.<br /><br />Roosts include cavities in live or dead trees, spaces behind loose tree bark, tree foliage, Spanish moss, leaf litter, rock crevices, abandoned burrows in the ground, and nooks, spaces, and crevices in many types of human-made structures; rarely caves (Barbour and Davis 1969; Watkins 1972; Chapman and Chapman 1990; Bowles et al. 1996, 2005; Menzel et al. 2001; Kurta et al. 2005; Boyles and Robbins 2006; Marks and Marks 2006; Miles et al. 2006; Perry and Thill 2008; Hein et al. 2009). Individuals roosting in trees frequently change roosts (e.g., Bowles et al. 1996, Menzel et al. 2001). Winter roosts are poorly known in most areas (e.g., Ammerman et al. 2012), but individuals in southwestern Missouri roosted primarily in trees and sometimes underground in January-February (Bowles et al. 2005). Maternity colonies may be found under loose bark, in tree cavities, in Spanish-moss, or in buildings."
Lasiurus seminolus,"Prefers moist thickets, forests, field borders; generally uses early and mid-successional habitats with thickets and vines, may range short distance into adjacent fields with sparse redcedars, may cross dirt roads (Morzillo et al. 2003). Builds nests and feeding platforms on the ground and above ground in the understory. Young are born in nests that usually are a few inches to 15 feet above ground in bushes and vines. In south-central Florida, nearly all daytime refuges were on the ground under leaf litter; a few were aboveground in shrubs (Frank and Layne 1992)."
Lontra canadensis,"White-tailed deer occupy many types of habitats in mountains and lowlands, including various forests and woodlands, forest edges, shrublands, grasslands with shrubs, and residential areas. They are often associated with successional vegetation, especially near agricultural lands. In the north in winter, they tend to be in areas with minimal snow cover (if possible) and often use stands of conifers for shelter. Within arid regions, white-tailed deer prefer mesic situations (riparian zones, montane woodlands)."
Lynx rufus,"Prefers fresh or brackish marshes, lakes, ponds, swamps, and other bodies of slow-moving water. Most abundant in areas with cattail. Rare or absent in large artificial impoundments where fluctuating water levels eliminate littoral zone plants (food supply) (Caire et al. 1989). Dens in bank burrow or conical house of vegetation in shallow vegetated water. Sometimes in uplands-Clough 1987. <br /><br />See Clark (1994) for information on habitat selection in experimental marshes undergoing succession in Manitoba."
Marmota monax,"This species is semi-aquatic and prefers saltwater and freshwater marshes (Boone et al. 2022, Goodyear 1987, Kruchek 2004, Rose 2020). It is also occasionally found in swamps, moist meadows, and agricultural crops (Cooney et al. 2015, Kruchek 2004). Subspecies <i>argentatus</i> prefers mangrove forests (Goodyear 1987, Taillie et al. 2020). Uplands bordering wetlands may be important as refuges during high tides (Kruchek 2004). Nests are placed in grassy vegetation under debris, or woven in aquatic emergents a foot or more above the high water line (Goodyear 1987, Taillie et al. 2020)."
Megaptera novaeangliae,"Deciduous woodlands with thick humus. Adapted to second growth stands, old fields, hedgerows. Prefers well-drained, light, moist soil with well-mixed organic matter and minerals. Avoids soils that are hard, dry, or with a large clay content. Two tunnel systems are constructed. Deeper system (10-18"" deep) gives resting, breeding space, and winter shelter. Males leave tunnel systems in search of females in breeding season."
Mephitis mephitis,"These bats are associated with forested landscapes, where they forage near trees (including forest perimeters) and along waterways (Fujita and Kunz 1984). In many areas, most foraging occurs in riparian areas (e.g., Ellis et al. 2002, Ford et al. 2005, Menzel et al. 2005). In Nova Scotia, they appeared to use primarily areas with intact, unfragmented forest cover (Farrow and Broders 2011). In spring and summer in deciduous forest in western North Carolina, nonreproductive individuals selected mature stands or buffer zones near perennial streams, and they tended to roost near openings (perhaps to minimize commuting costs when openings comprise a small proportion of a densely forested landscape) (O'Keefe et al. 2009).<br /><br />Maternity and other summer roosts probably are mainly in dead or live tree foliage (including attached lichen clumps such as <i>Usnea </i>and ""Spanish moss"") (Carter and Menzel 2007, Poissant et al. 2010); caves, mines, and rock crevices may be used as night roosts between foraging forays (Barbour and Davis 1969). Maternity colonies also may utilize human-made structures (buildings, bridges; e.g., Ferrara and Leberg 2005) or tree cavities; sometimes these are in open sites that would not be tolerated by most other bats (Barbour and Davis 1969). In summer in Arkansas, roosts were most often among dead leaves of oaks in mature (&gt;50-year-old) forest with a relatively complex structure and a hardwood component, but 3 of 7 maternity roosts were in clumps of dead needles of live, large pines (Perry and Thill 2007). In Indiana, pregnant and lactating females roosted exclusively in foliage, typically in clusters of dead leaves and less often in live foliage or squirrel nests (Veilleux et al. 2003). In Nova Scotia, colonies of females roost exclusively in clumps of the lichen <i>Usnea</i>, typically in spruce trees (Poissant et al. 2010). In Indiana, Veilleux and Veilleux (2004) provided limited evidence that females are faithful to small roost areas both within and between years, and that juvenile females exhibit female natal philopatry. Reproductive females roost alone or in groups of up to about 50 individuals (Perry and Thill 2007).<br /><br />Hibernation sites often are in caves (e.g., Briggler and Prather 2003), mines, or cavelike tunnels (e.g., Slider and Kurta 2011), also box culverts under highways, especially those near forest (Texas; Sandel et al. 2001). Kurta et al. (2007) recorded hibernation in a dam and colonization of a cave that had been highly altered for commercialization. Hibernating individuals perch singly, infrequently in small groups."
Mesoplodon densirostris,"In most areas, prefers bottomland hardwood forests, swamps, and mesic and hydric hammocks but has also been found in margins of cleared fields, old fields, edges of salt savanna, palmetto thickets bordering beaches, dry hammocks, beach dunes, pine flatwoods, upland timber, mixed pine-hardwood forests, pine-turkey oak, sand pine scrub, along rocky bluffs or ledges, in caves, and in little-used buildings (see Wolfe and Linzoy 1977). Probably most common in areas that periodically are inundated. Terrestrial and arboreal. Large logs and stumps are an important habitat component (McCay 2000). In south-central Florida, daytime refuges were primarily in gopher tortoise burrows, also in ground holes and occasionally in hollow tree cavities (Frank and Layne 1992). Young are born in nests in logs, stumps, moss, under loose bark, under brush, or in old buildings; prefers elevated nest sites, as much as 6 m above ground (see Kirkland and Layne 1989, Handley 1991)."
Mesoplodon europaeus,"Prefers woodland edges, brushy fields, clearcuts, riparian zones; primarily a forest dweller. In Pennsylvania, abundance increased with forest fragmentation (Yahner 1992), and in Indiana density was highest in forest patches of less than 2 ha (Krohne and Hoch 1999). In Ohio, summer habitats included roadsides, crop fields, and farmsteads; these may act as dispersal corridors between wooded habitats (Cummings and Vessey 1994). In Indiana, few mice dispersed through grassland or agricultural fields surrounding forest patches (Krohne and Hoch 1999). Nests are placed in a variety of sites; underground (especially in winter), under debris, in building, in log or stump, in tree cavity, in old squirrel or bird nest, or in bird nest box."
Microtus pennsylvanicus,"Uses a wide variety of upland and riparian habitats from open areas and brushlands to coniferous and deciduous forests. Nest sites as varied as habitat. May be placed in buildings, burrows, under logs, in thick vegetation, or in tree cavities."
Microtus pinetorum,"Favors dry sandy fields and beaches with grass/shrub cover; at Merritt Island, Florida, usually among clumps of palmetto and sea grape with expanses of open sand or among dense palmetto-sea grape-wax myrtle. Occupies underground burrows when inactive; entrances in clumps of grass or beneath sheltering vegetation (Matthews and Moseley 1990). Young are born in underground burrows."
Mus musculus,"Pelagic, prefers deep water, sometimes around islands or in shallow shelf waters (e.g., 40-70 m; Scott and Sadove 1997). Tend to occur in highest densities near productive waters, and often near steep drop-offs or strong oceanographic features, e.g. edges of continental shelves, large islands, and offshore banks and over submarine trenches and canyons (Gosho et al. 1984, Reeves and Whitehead 1997, Gregr and Trites 2001, Whitehead 2003). Females generally restricted to waters with surface temperatures warmer than about 15 degrees C and rarely found in waters less than 1000 m deep. Males, although primarily found in deep water, are sometimes found in waters 200 to 1000 m deep (Reeves and Whitehead 1997)."
Mustela nivalis,"Various habitats; usually in moist situations, often along streams and shorelines. Dens under logs or rock, in tree hole, ground burrow, or in bank den (Armstrong 1975)."
Myocastor coypus,Primarily pelagic; usually not near land except around oceanic islands and coast with deep water nearby (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983).
Myotis austroriparius,"Now associated generally with mountainous or remote undisturbed areas. May occupy wide variety of habitats: swamps, riparian woodlands, broken country with good cover of brush or woodland. Beier (1993) determined that habitat areas of at least 2200 sq km are needed to ensure long-term population persistence; protection of corridors for immigration is highly desirable. Young are born in secluded places among rocks or dense vegetation (e.g., see Beier et al. 1995, Bleich et al. 1996)."
Myotis grisescens,"Buildings and other structures in cities, villages, and farm country, also dumps and open areas near abundant food. Most common in colder climates of high latitudes; in warmer regions restricted to habitats highly modified by humans (Musser and Carleton, in Wilson and Reeder 1993). In Hawaii: locally common in some lowland cane fields, rare or absent in extensive grassland and most native forests (Tomich 1986). In Oklahoma, moved from fields to buildings in fall (Caire et al. 1989). Young are born in nests in buildings, under debris, or underground."
Myotis leibii,"Often associated with humans; buildings, sewers, seaports. In natural habitats in some areas (e.g., Pacific islands [wooded gulches, sugar cane fields, dry and wet forests, coconut palms] and West Indies). In Hawaii (western Mauna Kea), preferred dense tree stands and tall grass over open areas (Amarasekare 1994); abundant in mesic to wet native forest on Maui (Sugihara 1997). Often arboreal. Young are born in nests in protected sites in buildings or within other cover (e.g., ricebird nests in Hawaii, Van Riper 1974; coconut shells, Twibell 1973)."
Myotis lucifugus,"Prefers old fields, marshes, and wet meadows. Climbs among herbaceous vegetation. Nests are placed in tangled vegetation under debris or above ground."
Myotis septentrionalis,"Most commonly occurs in open areas with moist soils, such as lawns, meadows, and golf courses. Bottomland wooded areas also are utilized. Soft humid soils are preferred over gravelly, dry soils. Two types of underground passageways: near-surface and deep. Surface are commonly seen with their raised ridges. Deep (10-24"") provide wintering/breeding areas. Den sites often are located under protection of a surface object."
Myotis sodalis,"Prefers mature deciduous and mixed forests with abundant supplies of mast (e.g., acorns, hickory nuts). A diversity of nut trees is needed to support high densities. Also uses city parks and floodplains. Seldom far from permanent open water. In southern Alabama, narrow bands of hardwoods along ephemeral streams were an important component of the habitat in even-aged pine and mixed pine-hardwood stands (Fischer and Holler 1991). Rests in tree cavity or leaf nest; leaf nests apparently are made primarily by dispersing juveniles 18-19 weeks old. Nests in tree cavities or in leaf nests, usually 25 feet or more above ground. Most winter-spring litters are born in tree cavities, most spring-summer litters in leaf nests (Teaford 1986). Cavities suitable for nesting are dry, 15-25 cm in diameter, 40-50 cm deep, with an entrance hole about 8 cm in diameter (Teaford 1986). Females may move young from tree cavity nest to leaf nest, possibly to escape fleas."
Napaeozapus insignis,"Often in open mixed hardwood forest or mixed pine-hardwood associations, but has adapted well to disturbed areas, hedgerows, and city parks. Prefer savannas or open woodlands to dense forests (Flyger in Wilson and Ruff 1999). In Michigan, four favorite habitats in descending order: oak-hickory woodlands, beech-basswood-maple, scrub oak, and floodplains (Allen 1943). In the southeastern U.S., prinicipal habitat is mature open forests of longleaf pine and turkey oak with an open understory; adjacent bottomland hardwood forests may be occupied in summer and during periods of drought (see Handley 1991). Western range extensions are associated with riparian corridors of cottonwoods and fencerows of osage orange. Dens are in tree hollows (preferred) or leaf nests (especially in mild weather). Young are born in a tree cavity or leaf nest; tree hollows are preferred for rearing young. Individuals use up to about nine nests annually. <br><br>A few particular plant communities of the Coastal Plain appear to be important in maintaining fox squirrel populations there. The structure, age, diversity, and extent of these communities within the overall pine-oak forest provide an array of often subtle requirements for the success of the squirrel in the Southeast (Weigl et al. 1989). <br><br>In Florida and North Carolina, habitats are primarily longleaf pine (PINUS PALUSTRIS)-turkey oak (QUERCUS LAEVIS) sandhills characterized by large, well-spaced pines and an understory of scattered or clumped oaks (Moore 1953, Kantola 1986, Weigl et al. 1989, Cox 1990), although squirrels may also be found in other open pine stands, mixed pine-hardwood forests, and in ecotones between forest types. Habitat structure, specifically the size and spacing of pine and oak trees, appears to be more important than the actual species composition of the habitat (Taylor 1973, Hilliard 1979, Weigl et al. 1989). Only stands with large mature trees appear to supply adequate supplies of food and nesting sites. The large size of the eastern fox squirrel appears to adapt it to the openness of the pine-oak forest and the arrangements of habitats within the Coastal Plain. Large size is advantageous in handling the large cones of longleaf pine and in traveling along the ground between widely spaced trees, food sources, and blocks of habitat (Weigl et al. 1989). <br><br>Use of edge habitats by fox squirrels is repeatedly mentioned in the literature (Smith and Follmer 1972, Flyger and Smith 1980, Nixon et al. 1984, Kantola 1986, Weigl et al. 1989, Cox 1990). While fox squirrels in North Carolina Sandhills used pine-oak forest at least 80 percent of the time, there was marked seasonality in habitat use. During the winter months, fox squirrel activity was significantly higher in edge habitats and in bottomland forest, while in the summer months activity shifted from open pinelands and sand ridges toward moister lowlands (Weigl et al. 1989). Based on a one-year study of Florida fox squirrels, Kantola and Humphrey (1990) suggested that the best habitats may be the edges between longleaf pine savanna and live oak (QUERCUS VIRGINIANA) forest where the availability of oak mast may be most dependable from year to year. <br><br>Weigl et al. (1989) showed that fox squirrels chose nest sites surrounded by vegetation typical of longleaf pine-turkey oak forest (Wells and Shunk 1931, Braun 1964, Waggoner 1975, Christensen 1988). Fox squirrels nested in areas characterized by open, low diversity, mature forest with little understory and xeric conditions. This contrasted markedly with conditions typical of gray squirrel nest sites, which generally were in areas of closed-canopy, high diversity, dense understory, and generally mesic conditions. <br><br>Nests are of critical importance to the survival of fox squirrels throughout their range, and nest selection and use by eastern fox squirrels has received considerable attention (Moore 1957, Hilliard 1979, Flyger and Smith 1980, Weigl et al. 1989, Kantola and Humphrey 1990). Tree hollows are particularly important in rearing young and for protection from severe weather for all tree squirrels. <br><br>Fox squirrels in the southeastern U.S. often use hardwood cavities in deciduous forest, bottomlands, and mixed forests, despite the fact that the majority of foraging takes place in pine-dominated stands. Kantola and Humphrey (1990) also reported higher nest use in lower slope situations than on drier sandhill areas. Suitable hollows are fairly scarce in pine-oak forests, primarily owing to timber management practices, firewood cutting, and oak suppression (Weigl et al. 1989; Weigl, pers. comm.), but are more abundant in adjacent more mesic habitats. <br><br>Leaf nests are frequently used during warmer months and in the more southern portions of the squirrels' range. Use of leaf nests in North Carolina was associated with periods of mild weather and/or abundant food, and Weigl et al. (1989) found that nest selection during the warmest periods occurred most often in moister habitats and wetland edges. In Florida, tree cavity nests were rarely used even when abundant, comprising only 7.4% of all nest locations recorded (Kantola and Humphrey 1990)."
Neofiber alleni,"Favors dense, grassy fields and roadside edges; also in brushy or weedy areas or among reeds and cattails along streams or ponds, in irrigated fields, and in desertscrub with little grass. Nests typically are built under logs, rocks, underground."
Neogale frenata,N/A
Neogale vison,"Occupies most terrestrial habitats excluding areas with very little or no vegetation. Thick leaf litter in damp forests may represent favored habitat, although appears adaptable to major successional disturbances. In Nova Scotia, diet indicated that much foraging was done among wrack on beaches (Stewart et al. 1989). Nest sites are typically in shallow burrows or above ground in logs and stumps."
Neogale vison lutensis,"Mountainous, forested areas (deciduous or evergreen) with loose talus. Rocky damp areas with deep crevices covered by leaf mold and roots are preferred. May occur along small mountain streams. Will use artificial talus created by road construction and pit mines. ""SOREX DISPAR is probably the most stenotopic mammal in eastern North America..."" (Webster 1987). Trapping results reported by Richmond and Grimm (1950) suggest that Long-tailed Shrews spend most of their time in the labyrinth of spaces between rocks about a foot beneath the surface. Nest sites are usually associated with natural subterranean tunnels among boulder crevices."
Neotoma floridana,"Most abundant in damp wooded areas, both in conifer and hardwood habitats. Nest sites are beneath stumps, rotted logs, or rocks (Whitaker, in Wilson and Ruff 1999)."
Neotoma floridana haematoreia,"Found in a variety of habitats. Appears to prefer grassy openings of boreal forest. Moist habitats are preferred over dry areas. In Kentucky-Tennessee, much less active above ground than was <i>S. longirostris</i> (Feldhamer et al. 1993). Nest sites are not well known."
Neotoma floridana illinoensis,"Various habitats ranging from bogs and damp woods to upland shrubby or wooded areas; apparently prefers moist to wet areas, usually bordering swamps, marshes, or rivers, and most often associated with heavy ground cover (French 1980). Generally resides underground or under ground cover. Might respond favorably to disturbances that allow dense ground cover to thrive (Pagels et al. 1982). <br><br>Subspecies EIONIS: cypress swamps, bay swamps, hydric hammocks, slash pine and longleaf pine flatwoods, palmetto thickets, longleaf pine sandhills, xeric hammocks, sand pine scrub, clear-cuts. Subspecies LONGIROSTRIS: various lowland habitats, fields and forest edges in mountains, areas with heavy ground vegetation; in Virginia, common throughout the Piedmont and Coastal Plain, uncommon in western highlands. Subspecies FISHERI: most abundant in mesic successional habitats (Jones et al. 1991)."
Nycticeius humeralis,"Prefer forested areas or habitats with significant cover (Dragoo and Honeycutt, in Wilson and Ruff 1999). Also open and brushy areas, rocky canyons and outcrops in woodlands and prairies. When inactive or bearing young, occupies den in burrow abandoned by other mammal, under brushpile, in hollow log or tree, in rock crevice, under building, or in similar protected site."
Ochrotomys nuttalli,"Along southeastern U.S.: continental shelf, usually inside or near 185 m contour (within 250-350 km of coast); sometimes moves into very shallow water near shore (usually replaced in shallow water by Unrankable RSIOPS). Offshore distribution poorly known."
Odocoileus virginianus,"Tropical and warm temperate seas, especially far offshore in deep water; normally where sea surface temperature is above 25 C (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Sometimes associated with yellowfin tuna in eastern tropical Pacific."
Odocoileus virginianus nigribarbis,"Densely forested mountainous terrain, brushlands, dry ridges, swamps; sometimes in fields, marshes. Often in mixed hardwood forest with permanent water source. Seasonal changes in habitat use are linked to food availability. In southern Texas, prime habitat is open brush-savanna with free water (Ilse and Hellgren 1995). Young are born in a secluded spot in dense thicket or shaded area on high dry ground."
Ondatra zibethicus,"Usually restricted to floodplains, bottomlands, riparian areas. Prefers mature forests. Associated with dense, brushy thickets in wooded floodplains along borders of lakes, river, and swamps. Commonly seeks water to escape danger. Nests are built in slight depressions in ground under brush piles or fallen branches, in hollow logs, or in holes along banks. Females regularly build dummy nests."
Oryzomys palustris,"Early mid-successional habitats over much of continental U.S. May be found in brushy areas, open woodlands, swampy areas, stream valleys, grasslands, and suburbs. Very adaptable species. Usually absent from boreal habitats and dense woods. Nests usually are in shallow depressions in thick vegetation or in underground burrows. Does not dig burrows."
Parascalops breweri,"Strictly associated with dense cover and conifers at higher elevations; conifers and heaths, especially KALMIA and VACCINIUM (Maryland, West Virginia, Georgia, Alabama); 6-7-year-old clear cuts (Virginia); areas of heath and scrubby conifers, maintained by periodic fires, adjacent to deciduous growth (Chapman et al. 1992). In western Maryland, used areas with dense understory vegetation within mature mixed-oak forest or patches of recent clearcuts; avoided steep slopes (Barry et al. 1996). <br><br>Nests are made in a depression on the ground, sometimes at the base of a stump, lined with grass and fur and capped with twigs and leaves. (Dalke 1942, Tefft and Chapman 1983). They are usually in brush or woods rather than grasslands (Dalke 1937)."
Perimyotis subflavus,Confined solely to marshy habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Prefers relatively undisturbed marshes (Handley 1991). May also be found around inland lakes. Availability of water is the most important factor limiting the distribution (Blair 1936). Does not occupy burrows. Good swimmer. Nests usually are in grassy vegetation adjacent to water bodies.
Peromyscus gossypinus,"Prefers boggy habitat but also common in marshes, meadows, and upland forests with thick humus layer (especially when conditions not hot and dry); areas with intermixture of herbaceous/shrubby vegetation. Occupies burrow systems usually 6-12 inches deep and surface runways (e.g., beneath sphagnum and among roots of shrubs). Young are born in nests placed on the surface in grassy vegetation or in underground burrows. In New Jersey, nests were just under the surface in tops of sphagnum hummocks (Conner 1959)."
Peromyscus leucopus,"Habitat ranges from lowland deserts, shrublands, woodlands, and forests to high mountains. Major roosts are primarily in caves in the southwestern United States; generally buildings (generally old ones) in the southeastern United States (sometimes in hollow trees), along the U.S. West Coast, and in Jamaica; in both buildings and caves in Puerto Rico. Individuals may roost in cliff faces and other rock crevices, under bridges, on signs, or in cliff swallow nests during migration. Generally these bats roost high (at least 3 meters) above the ground to allow the amount of free fall required to attain flight. Large maternity colonies inhabit buildings and caves (rarely used in Florida); culverts and bridges may also serve as maternity sites. Individuals tend to return to their natal cave to breed (Caire et al. 1989). Foraging bats make use of agricultural landscapes and natural habitats; in Texas, the latter were most important in late summer (Davidai et al. 2015)."
Peromyscus maniculatus,"Prefers deciduous woodlands with ample cover, such as brush piles/logs, rocky forested slopes, ravines. Also found in brushlands and hedgerows. Commonly climbs trees/shrubs. Burrows often open at edge or rock, near base of tree, or under edge of building. Nest is generally constructed below ground in an extensive burrow system."
Peromyscus polionotus,"Prefers coniferous and mixed forests, but also occurs in deciduous woodlots, hedgerows, second-growth areas. Prefers to nest in tree cavities; also constructs leaf nests and uses ground burrows."
Physeter macrocephalus,"Habitat includes shallow coastal waters, estuaries, bays, rivers, and lakes; throughout most of the range, manatees appear to prefer rivers and estuaries over marine habitats (Lefebvre et al. 1989). Manatees are not averse to traveling through dredged canals or using quiet marinas. They apparently are not able to tolerate prolonged exposure to water colder than 20 C. In the north during October-April, manatees congregate in warmer water bodies (spring-fed rivers, outfalls from power plants). They prefer waters at least 1-2 meters in depth; along the coast manatees often are in water 3-5 meters deep, usually in areas lacking strong current. Except in the Greater Antilles, manatees are consistently associated with freshwater sources (Lefebvre et al. 1989). In Brevard County, Florida, the cul-de-sac shelter type was the most ecologically valuable of all shelter types (Burke 1994).<br /><br />In Florida, manatees occur in freshwater, brackish, and marine environments; typical coastal and inland habitats include coastal tidal rivers and streams, mangrove swamps, salt marshes, freshwater springs, and vegetated bottoms; where feeding often occurs in shallow grass beds, with ready access to deep channels (Smith 1993). In coastal Georgia and northeastern Florida, manatees feed on smooth cordgrass (<i>Spartina alterniflora</i>) in salt marshes at high tide (Baugh et al. 1989, Zoodsma 1991). Manatees drink from springs and freshwater runoff sites, mating, calving, and care of young often occur in secluded canals, creeks, embayments, and lagoons (Marine Mammal Commission 1986, 1988; O'Shea and Ludlow 1992; Gannon et al. 2007).<br /><br />In Puerto Rico, manatees are primarily marine but appear to depend on access to fresh water, and seagrass beds provide the primary foraging habitat (USFWS 2007)."
Procyon lotor,"Offshore form frequents pelagic waters, especially in tropics. Coastal form usually shoreward of 20 m contour, often in lagoons, bays, river mouths; ascends river in some areas; common near passes connecting large bays with ocean. Young are born in the water."
Pseudorca crassidens,"Often in woodland and shrubland in rough, broken country. Usually avoids open areas. May climb tree to avoid danger. Dens in cleft, small cave, hollow in tree or log, or debris pile; less frequently in burrow abandoned by other mammal."
Puma concolor,"Black bears inhabit forests and nearby openings, including forested wetlands. When inactive, they occupy dens under fallen trees, ground-level or above-ground tree cavities or hollow logs, underground cave-like sites, or the ground surface in dense cover. Young are born in a den. A low rate of den reuse was recorded in Pennsylvania.<br /><br />These bears prefer mixed deciduous-coniferous forests with a thick understory but may occur in various situations. Large hardwood swamps and pocosins are important habitats on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. In the Great Dismal Swamp, Virginia and North Carolina, preferred habitats were pocosins, gum-cypress and maple-coniferous stands, disturbed areas, and roads; females exhibited seasonal changes in habitat preference (Hellgren and Vaughan 1991). In some areas (e.g., Alaska), bears make significant use of salmon spawning streams. In southeastern wetlands, bears would benefit from maintenance and enhancement of pocosins, mature gum, oak, and disturbed habitats (Hellgren et al. 1991)."
Puma concolor coryi,"Various open and semi-open habitats. Usually avoids dense forest, although open woodlands frequently are used. Sometimes occurs in suburban areas or even cities (e.g., in England). May range onto sea ice (Labrador). Maternity dens are in burrows dug by fox or abandoned by other mammals, often in open fields or wooded areas, sometimes under rural buildings, in hollow logs, under stumps, etc."
Puma concolor couguar,N/A
Rattus norvegicus,"Generally but not always in deeper, offshore tropical and temperate waters, usually outside the 1000 m contour (Houston 1991)."
Rattus rattus,N/A
Reithrodontomys humulis,"Copperheads are often in or near deciduous forest in hilly situations, usually in the vicinity of rock outcrops; they occur also on floodplains and at edges of swamps in the south and in mesic situations near water in the arid west. Hibernation generally occurs in dens among rocks, or in caves, animal burrows, under objects, in hollow logs or stumps, or in similar sites. Usually copperheads area in areas with abundant surface cover such as rocks, logs, stumps, or leaf litter. They are mainly terrestrial but sometimes climb into vegetation up to a few meters above ground. In the east at least, gravid females select rocky areas that are more open and have warmer soil temperatures than those used by nongravid individuals (Reinert, cited by Ernst 1992)."
Scalopus aquaticus,"This snake occurs in a wide range of aquatic and wetland habitats: swamps, sloughs, delta bayous, bayheads, ponds and streams in pine flatwoods, pine-palmetto forest, offshore keys, marshes, river bottoms, lowland floodplains, tidal stream courses, dune and beach areas, clear upland brooks, drainage ditches in some southern cities, brackish waters, and sometimes salt marshes (Ernst and Ernst 2003, Campbell and Lamar 2004). Cottonmouths may aggregate under waterbird rookeries. Hibernation sites include rocky wooded hillsides, in crayfish burrows, under rotting stumps or other cover, or in burrows of mammals (e.g., beavers, muskrats) or tortoises."
Sciurus carolinensis,"This mostly arboreal lizard occupies a wide variety of habitats, including upland forests, pine-palmetto scrublands, rocky escarpments, swamps, wooded parks, cleared fields, maritime scrub, and residential lots of coastal towns (Palmer and Braswell 1995, Bartlett and Bartlett 1999, Trauth et al. 2004); commonly it is in edge situations. It climbs on tree trunks, shrubs, vines, and various other plants, and also on fence posts and walls of buildings. It sleeps in vegetation at night. In cold weather, green anoles seek cover but do not go deep underground (Mount 1975). Eggs are buried in moist soil, sphagnum, leaf litter, rotting wood, or under rocks and debris."
Sciurus niger,"Various sunny habitats; rarely in deep woods or forests. Coastal areas and mountains, dry areas and in lush vegetation. In Florida generally confined to urban/suburban areas but also in semi-natural habitats along roadways and in stands of introduced trees. Trunk-ground species. Found on trees, shrubs, fences, walls, lumber and rock piles, trash piles, around buildings, and on or near ground. Presumably spends night under terrestrial objects."
Sciurus niger niger,"Six-lined racerunners inhabit grassland, sandhills, sandy or gravelly banks and floodplains of streams, sparsely vegetated rocky areas at the base of mountains, woodland edges and open woods, beach dunes, and similar situations with full or partial sun exposure. They generally take shelter underground or under rocks or other objects on the ground; sometimes they escape threats by submerging in pools of water and may remained submerged by at least a few minutes. Eggs are laid in a nest dug in soft soil or sawdust pile (Mount 1975) or under logs or other sheltering objects (Barbour 1971)."
Sigmodon hispidus,"The habitat consists of mesic, wooded or partially wooded areas (hardwood or pine), often along edges or ecotones, such as near wetlands or margins of farm fields, and often in hilly areas but sometimes in flatwoods (Dundee and Rossman 1989, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Hulse et al. 2001, Ernst and Ernst 2003). This snake occurs in loose damp soil, under surface cover or leaf litter, or in rotted logs; it goes deep undergound during cold or dry weather. Eggs are laid under rocks, in rotting logs, stumps, or sawdust piles (Mount 1975, Collins 1982)."
Sorex albibarbis,"This secretive, semifossorial snake inhabits hardwood, mixed, or pine forest/woodland and adjacent open areas with sandy or loamy well-drained soils (Behler and King 1979, Trauth et al. 2004). Specific habitats include pine flatwoods, dry or dry prairie, salt grass prairie, maritime hardwood hammock, bottomland forest, sandhills, margins of irrigation canals in sawgrass prairies, borders of swamps and plowed fields, abandoned fields, and roadsides (Tennant 1984, 1997; Werler and Dixon 2000). Individuals are sometimes found under rocks or in or under logs. Eggs are laid under moist humus (Minton 1972) or in other underground sites."
Sorex cinereus,"Habitats encompass a wide range of lowland and montane areas, including deserts, prairies, sandhills, shrublands, woodlands, forests, canyons, streamsides, and semi-agricultural areas. This snake is absent from the driest deserts and highest mountains (subalpine zones and higher). It commonly climbs shrubs and small trees. When inactive, it hides underground, in crevices, or under surface cover. Adults often hibernate communally, sometimes partly submerged in water. Eggs are laid in underground tunnels or burrows, rotting stumps, sawdust piles, or under rocks. Oviposition sites may be up to at least several hundred meters from the usual home range (Brown and Parker 1976, Iverson et al. 1995)."
Sorex cinereus cinereus,"This snake occurs in a wide range of habitats: desert, prairie, scrubland, juniper-grassland, woodland, thornforest, farmland, creek valleys, and sometimes swamps; usually in relatively dry open terrain. It is terrestrial but also climbs into vegetation. It seeks cover in burrows, among rocks, or in vegetation."
Sorex dispar,"Habitats include pine and wiregrass flatwoods, pine-palmetto flatwoods, longleaf pine-turkey oak hills, rosemary scrub, mesophytic and coastal maritime hammocks, xeric hammocks, barrier islands and coastal scrub habitats, vicinity of wet savannas, wet prairies (during dry periods), dry prairie, mixed pine-hardwood successional woodland, and abandoned farms and fields (especially near pine-dominated habitats), particularly areas with abundant cover (Mount 1975, Dundee and Rossman 1989, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Tennant 1997, Ernst and Ernst 2003, Campbell and Lamar 2004, Means 2017). Large tracts of habitat are most suitable. Eastern diamondbacks are basically terrestrial and rarely climb into vegetation. Shelters include stump holes, burrows of other animals, brush piles, or similar sites. Stumpholes in shortleaf/loblolly pine oldfield successional forest are utilized more frequently than burrows of the gopher tortoise (Means 2017). Eastern diamondbacks can tolerate temporary inundation of their overwintering burrows (Means 1982, 2017). According to Ernst (1992), most young are born in retreats such as gopher tortoise burrows or hollow logs."
Sorex fumeus,"In the Northeast, this species inhabits mountainous or hilly deciduous or mixed deciduous-coniferous forest, often with rocky outcroppings, steep ledges, and rock slides (Petersen and Fritsch 1986, Brown 1993). In the upper Midwest, this snake occurs on steep rocky bluffs and bluff prairies with oaks (Breckenridge 1944, Oldfield and Keyler 1989, Vogt 1981). In the central midwest, optimum habitat is a high, dry ridge with oak-hickory forest interspersed with open areas (Minton 1972), and ""deciduous forest, especially along hilltop rock outcrops in thick woods"" (Fitch 1958). In the South, preferred habitat is ""hardwood forests of the type found in Loess Bluff and in many river bottoms"" (Cook 1943), swampy areas and floodplains (Mount 1975), wet pine flatwoods, river bottoms and hydric hammocks (Ashton and Ashton 1981), and hardwood forests and cane fields of alluvial plain and hill country (Dundee and Rossman 1989). Fogell et al. (2002) documented a relatively high level of agricultural field use at the western edge of the range in Nebraska. Activity is primarily terrestrial, but timber rattlesnakes sometimes climb into vegetation (see Fogell et al. (2002).<br><br>Hibernacula are typically located in a rocky area where underground crevices provide retreats for overwintering, such as a fissure in a ledge, a crevice between ledge and ground, talus (rock slide) below a cliff, open skree slope (fallen rocks not associated with a cliff), or fallen rock (talus or skree) partly covered by soil (Martin 1989). At least in the northeastern part of the range (Reinert 1984, Reinert and Zappalorti 1988, Hammerson and Lemieux 2001), males and nongravid females are primarily forest dwellers and gravid females use open, sparsely forested sites. Similarly, in Wisconsin Keenlyne (1972) reported gravid females using flat slab rocks and grassy, open slopes. This open habitat was not used by males or nongravid females. ""Transient habitat"" a somewhat arbitrary category, generally is within 200 m of a den. It tends to be broken by the rough topography and rocky terrain near the den site and supports more open woodland with exposed clearings and shelter rocks. This habitat occurs on outcrop knolls (Brown 1989) used as ""stop-over"" basking locations by rattlesnakes migrating away from a den in spring. This habitat also is used by gravid females during their reproductive year."
Sorex hoyi,"This snake occurs in forests, woodlands, grassland, chaparral, and riparian corridors in arid regions (Stebbins 2003). Habitats are moist, at least seasonally. One or multiple individuals often are found near abandoned buildings and in junk piles in wooded areas. During daylight hours, this snake generally hides underground, in or under logs, or under rocks, stumps or other surface cover. Eggs are laid (often communally) underground or under logs or rocks."
Sorex longirostris,"Habitat includes sandhill regions dominated by mature longleaf pines, turkey oaks, and wiregrass; flatwoods; most types of hammocks; coastal scrub; dry glades; palmetto flats; prairie; brushy riparian and canal corridors; and wet fields (Matthews and Moseley 1990, Tennant 1997, Ernst and Ernst 2003). Occupied sites are often near wetlands and frequently are in association with gopher tortoise burrows.  Pineland habitat is maintained by periodic fires. Viable populations of this species require relatively large tracts of suitable habitat. Refuges include tortoise burrows, stump holes, land crab burrows, armadillo burrows, or similar sites. Eggs may be laid in gopher (<i>Geomys</i>) burrows (Ashton and Ashton 1981). See USFWS (1998) for further information."
Spilogale putorius,"Habitat includes marshes, swampy weedy lake margins, wetlands along the edges of large rivers, oxbow lakes, beaver ponds, slow mud-bottomed streams, shallow sloughs with rotting logs, floodplains, drainage ditches, and brackish tidal areas (Dundee and Rossman 1989, Werler and Dixon 2000, Ernst and Ernst 2003, Trauth et al. 2004). This fossorial, semiaquatic snake burrows in soft soil and among wet debris and mats of vegetation along the water's edge. Eggs are laid in earthen cavity, sometimes in alligator nests (Copeia 1993:219-222). In South Carolina, juveniles entered aquatic habitats in spring (mainly) or in fall (Semlitsch et al. 1988)."
Stenella frontalis,"This snake lives primarily in or near rivers, creeks, swamps, springs, open marshes, including brackish tidal areas; it burrows into soil, wet debris, and mats of vegetation along the water's edge, and it may shelter among cypress roots, logs, stone piles, or dock pillings; in some areas hibernation occurs in uplands near water (Mount 1975, Dundee and Rossman 1989, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Ernst and Ernst 2003). In South Carolina, hatchlings presumably overwintered on land in the vicinity of the nest; in March and April they moved overland to an aquatic site where they remained if conditions remained suitable; they moved to a neighboring aquatic area if the site became unsuitable (Gibbons et al. 1977). Eggs are laid in a cavity in sandy soil."
Steno bredanensis,"Habitats include rocky hillsides of dry open woods, limestone and sandstone cedar glades, woodland edge, mesic woodland and grassland, pastures, thickly wooded bottomlands, dry and mesic hammocks, pine flatwoods, wooded margins of streams in arid landscapes, swamp borders, gardens, and (often) vacant lots or woodlots in urban areas; this secretive semifossorial snake is usually in areas with moisture, ground cover, and some exposure to sunlight; often is found in rotting stumps or under rocks, logs, trash, loose bark, or other cover (Mitchell 1994, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Ernst and Ernst 2003, Trauth et al. 2004)."
Sus scrofa,"In New World, usually on or in occupied buildings, on walls and ceilings (in old cemetery in Key West); also under palm leaves, tree bark crevices, and rocky outcrops. <br><br>Nest sites include dirt piles, beneath boards, rotten tree stumps, rock crevices, trash piles, and building eaves."
Sylvilagus aquaticus,"Habitats include openly wooded upland hills, forest edges, fields, woodland meadows, prairies, forest-grassland ecotones, sand plains, barrier islands, fire-managed pinelands, river valleys, riparian zones, and various other habitats with loose soils and amphibian prey. This snake crawls on the surface and burrows into soil. It overwinters in burrows (made by mammal or self-dug) or under rocks of talus slopes. Eggs are laid in nests a few inches below the ground surface (Platt 1969) or in rotting wood (DeGraaf and Rudis 1983)."
Sylvilagus floridanus,"This snake inhabits open, xeric habitats with well-drained, sandy or sandy-loam soils such as sand ridges, stabilized coastal sand dunes, pine flatwoods, mixed oak-pine woodlands and forests, scrub oak woods, and oak hammocks; also old fields and river floodplains (Ashton and Ashton 1981, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Tennant 1997, Ernst and Ernst 2003). This snake spends considerable time burrowed in the soil."
Sylvilagus obscurus,"Habitats include pine flatwoods and wet prairie hammocks; less frequently bottomland, mixed hardwood, and upland pine forest, sandhills, and maritime hammock; rare in extensive grassy wetlands (except ""limestone-lined banks of sugar cane irrigation fields"") (Tennant 1997). Stumps and logs are commonly used as cover."
Sylvilagus palustris,"This primarily terrestrial species occurs in a wide range of habitats, often in or near wooded areas, commonly in the vicinity of water bodies and wetlands. Periods of inactivity are spent in crevices or burrows, or under rocks, logs, stumps, vegetation, or other cover."
Synaptomys cooperi,"This species occurs in dry rocky hills, open woods, dry prairies, stream valleys, and many other habitats."
Tadarida brasiliensis,N/A
Tamias striatus,"Habitats vary greatly among different geographic regions: semiarid to wet, lowland valleys to mountains, grasslands and shrublands to forests and forest edges, primary forest to secondary forest, sand dunes to rocky areas, and wilderness to semiagricultural and suburban (Campbell 1998, Lee 2000, Savage 2002, Ernst and Ernst 2003, Stebbins 2003). During daylight, this secretive generally hides in logs and stumps and under surface cover but also may be found in the open. It hibernates underground or in a deep rock crevice. Eggs are laid in soil, sawdust piles, or under surface cover."
Tamiasciurus hudsonicus,"This highly aquatic snake is usually in dense vegetation in shallow water of marshes, seasonally flooded prairies, swamps, sloughs, canals, lakes, sphagnum bogs, flatwoods ponds, temporary and permanent ponds, pocosins, or sluggish rivers (Ernst and Ernst 2003), primarily in areas that are not heavily shaded. Evidence for occurrence in brackish water is weak. Sometimes this snake traverses land, especially in humid or wet weather. Refuges include various burrows, including those made by crayfish, and spaces among or under wood or thick vegetation."
Trichechus manatus,"Habitats include swamps, bayheads, Carolina bays, ponds, marshes, grassy wet prairies, sphagnum bogs, sluggish streams, ditches, canals, and lakes with abundant floating or emergent vegetation; sometimes this species has been found in salt marshes or brackish tidal water; usually this snake is found among vegetation in water or in or under debris at the water's edge, including matted vegetation of round-tailed muskrat houses; it may travel on land after heavy summer rains or when pond basins dry (Palmer and Braswell 1995, Ernst and Ernst 2003, Gibbons and Dorcas 2004). In north-central Florida, individuals moved between temporary ponds and larger bodies of water; certain temporary ponds may comprise developmental habitat (Dodd 1993)."
Tursiops erebennus,"Habitats include slow waters of lowland areas, such as swamps, nontidal and tidal freshwater marshes, sphagnum bogs, pocosins, seepage wetlands, ponds, lakes, flatwoods ponds, cypress ponds, bayous, rice fields, canals, drainage ditches, mucky areas along streams, and floodplains; also sometimes grassy or wooded upland habitats adjacent to wetlands (Ernst and Ernst 2003, Gibbons and Dorcas 2004). Usually this snake is secluded in burrows (e.g., crayfish, muskrat), under mats of wet vegetation or debris at the water's edge, or among aquatic plants, but occasionally it basks on banks or on vegetation over water. It may travel on land during rain."
Tursiops truncatus,"Habitats include hardwood forest, pine-oak woodland, pine flatwoods, and xerophytic scrub, often in areas with sandy soils, sometimes marsh edges and residential areas (Mount 1975, Ashton and Ashton 1981, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Tennant 1997, Ernst and Ernst 2003). This secretive snake is often underground, under leaf litter, logs or stumps, or similarly secluded. Eggs probably are laid in loose soil or decaying organic matter (Mount 1975), or underground or under leaf litter or surface objects (Ernst 1992)."
Urocyon cinereoargenteus,"This snake occurs in a wide array of aquatic/wetland habitats, generally with permanent or semipermanent water, such as forested and shrubby swamps, marshes, edges of ponds and lakes, ditches, and slow streams. It often basks or rests in water-edge vegetation. It wanders far from water, especially during warm wet weather. Hibernatation sites are underground, under rockpiles, etc."
Ursus americanus,"Habitat consists primarily of vegetated freshwater ponds, lakes, marshes, wet prairies, sluggish streams and rivers, drainage ditches, and swamps, extending in some areas seaward to the edge of salt water meadows and marshes and mangrove swamps (Barbour 1971; Tennant 1997, 1998; Johnson 2000; Werler and Dixon 2000; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Trauth et al. 2004). This snake basks on banks and in edge vegetation. It shelters in bank-side burrows or under vegetative debris."
Ursus americanus americanus,"Habitat consists of vegetated shallow lakes, ponds, marshes, wet prairies, rice fields, slow rivers, ditches with abundant vegetation, and other wetlands that are not much shaded, including brackish water in some areas (Tennant 1997, Ernst and Ernst 2003, Gibbons and Dorcas 2004). Basking sites are on grassy edges and in branches over water. This snake may travel overland at night; it seeks cover in water, and it also uses muskrat lodges."
Ursus americanus floridanus,"Habitats include creeks, rivers, canals, lakes, oxbows, ponds, reservoirs, marshes, bogs, and swamps. This snake usually inhabits freshwater but also occurs in brackish and saltwater habitats in some areas (Ernst and Ernst 2003, Gibbons and Dorcas 2004). It frequents sunny areas, especially piles of flood-deposited debris, logs, or rocks, at the water's edge. Hibernation sites often are in burrows, among rocks, or in deep crevices, at the water's edge or in uplands near water."
Vulpes vulpes,"This snake inhabits rivers, large creeks, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, swamps, and marshes, including brackish tidal waters in some areas; it often climbs into woody vegetation overhanging the water, and it also perches on fallen trees, jetties, duck blinds, debris or other object along shorelines (Ernst and Ernst 2003, Gibbons and Dorcas 2004). In South Carolina, is was significantly associated with the steep-banked outer bends of the river and with areas having good perch-site availability; only large individuals crossed a 100-meter-wide river (Mills et al. 1995)."
Zapus hudsonius,"This snake typically inhabits dense vegetation (vines, shrubs, trees) near water; often at forest edges or in fairly open forests; also overgrown pasture, tallgrass prairie, thickets, barrier islands; open marsh and spoil banks in Louisiana; pine-oak, mesic hardwood hammocks, and occasionally mangrove swamps in Florida (see Walley and Plummer 2000). It is mostly arboreal but less so in spring and fall. In Arkansas, it avoids basking (Plummer 1993). It occupies vegetation above ground at night in warmer months; underground in cold weather. <br><br>Eggs are laid under objects in damp areas (Ashton and Ashton 1981), in rotting logs (Goldsmith 1984), or in tree hollows. May nest communally. In Arkansas, gravid females moved 5-75 m (average 36 m) terrestrially away from lake shore and oviposited in small chambers within the hollowed interiors of small living trees, 25-300 cm above ground; individuals may return to specific tree each year (Plummer 1989, 1990)."
Ziphius cavirostris,"Habitats include open grassland, prairie, woodland edge, open woodland, oak savannas, longleaf pine flatwoods, scrubby areas, fallow fields, and areas near streams and ponds, often in habitats with sandy soil. This species often appears on roads in spring. During inactivity, it occurs in underground burrows. In Kansas, slender glass lizards were scarce in heavily grazed pastures, increased as grass increased with removal of grazing, and declined as brush and trees replaced grass (Fitch 1989). <br /><br />Eggs are laid underground, under cover, or under grass clumps (Ashton and Ashton 1985); in cavities beneath flat rocks or in abandoned tunnels of small mammals (<i>Scalopus</i>, <i>Microtus</i>) (Fitch 1989)."
Agkistrodon conanti,"Habitat includes scrub vegetation on old coastal sand dunes (where the species often can be found under tidal wrack), sand pine scrub, longleaf pine-turkey oak, coastal hammocks, and dry pine flatwoods inland (Holman 1971, Ashton and Ashton 1985, Bartlett and Bartlett 1999). The species is most often encountered crossing roads in late afternoon or at dusk (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999). Eggs are laid probably in an underground nest."
Agkistrodon contortrix,"<span><span>The mimic glass lizard generally occurs in longleaf (occasionally slash) pine-dominated uplands with grassy groundcover, particularly mesic to wet flatwoods, but infrequently in more xeric communities such as sandhill and upland pine; canopy is generally open, and there is little midstory. The species is sometimes found in hillside seepage bogs, the edges of dome swamps, and wet prairies where these communities are closely associated with pine uplands (Krysko et al. 2019, Stevenson et al. 2023).</span></span>"
Agkistrodon piscivorus,"Habitats include moist and dry areas (especially the former), including damp grassy areas, maritime forests, open and scrubby woods (mesic hammock, pine flatwoods), vacant lots in coastal towns (Schwartz and Henderson 1991, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Bartlett and Bartlett 1999). This lizard can be found under debris in fields and vacant lots near ponds, marshes, and estuaries. It favors areas with sandy friable soils and abundant shelter on ground. It is regarded as semifossorial. Eggs are laid under or at base of grass clumps (Ashton and Ashton 1985) or under debris on ground (Mount 1975)."
Anolis carolinensis,"Habitat includes hardwood forest and woodland, wooded canyons, swamps, rocky timbered upland, wooded areas of streams and rivers, farmland near woods, old fields, barnyards, rural buildings. This species often occurs where wooded and open habitats (such as fields or farmland) are intermixed. It is terrestrial and also often climbs trees; may enter water. Hibernation occurs in deep crevices, or underground."
Anolis sagrei,"Habitat includes pine woodlands, brushy fields, open hardwood forests, mangrove thickets, barnyards, abandoned buildings, areas near springs, old trash dumps, and caves (near entrance) (Ernst and Ernst 2003). Terrestrial and arboreal. On Grand Cayman Island, this snake is associated with shrubbery and imported trees from Miami, Florida. <br><br>Clutches have been found at the edge of an abandoned sawdust pile (Ashton and Ashton 1981)."
Aspidoscelis sexlineatus,"Habitat includes hardwood forest and woodland, wooded canyons, swamps, rocky timbered upland, wooded areas of streams and rivers, farmland near woods, old fields, barnyards, rural buildings. This species often occurs where wooded and open habitats (such as fields or farmland) are intermixed. This is a terrestrial snake that often climbs trees, and it may enter water. Hibernation occurs in deep crevices, or underground. See Prior and Weatherhead (1996) for information on hibernacula in Ontario, Canada (locations varied greatly but tended to be on rocky south-facing slopes; some sites that looked suitable were not used)."
Carphophis amoenus,"This lizard inhabits open arid and semiarid regions with sparse vegetation (deserts, prairies, playa edges, bajadas, dunes, foothills) with grass, cactus, or scattered brush or scrubby trees (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Bartlett and Bartlett 1999, Hammerson 1999, Stebbins 2003). Soil may vary in texture from sandy to rocky. When inactive, individuals burrow into the soil, enter rodent burrows, or hide under rocks. Sheffield and Carter (1994, Herpetol. Rev. 25:67-68) reported individuals that climbed 1-2 m up tree trunks when soils were wet after heavy rains. Eggs are laid in nests dug in soil or under rocks (Collins 1982)."
Cemophora coccinea,"Good quality pinesnake habitat appears to be characterized by xeric, pine-dominated or pine-oak (50 to 80% pine) woodland with an open, low understory established on sandy soils. Longleaf pine sandhills appear to represent critical habitat over much of the southeastern United States. Pinesnakes also require forest openings, with level, well-drained sandy soils and little shrub cover, as nesting and hibernation sites.<br><br>This snake is terrestrial, fossorial, and arboreal. It remains underground in cold weather and during the hot midday period in summer (Fitch 1956, Zappalorti et al. 1983, Burger et al. 1988). It may occupy mammal burrows (Schroder 1950, Fitch 1958) or dig its own burrow, aided by a pointed snout and enlarged rostral scale; it is an accomplished burrower in loose soil (Franz 1992). Eggs are deposited in burrows excavated by the female in loose soil (Moore 1893; Zappalorti et al. 1983; Burger and Zappalorti 1986, 1991), spaces beneath large rocks or logs, or possibly small mammal burrows (Ernst and Barbour 1989, Franz 1992). <br><br>New Jersey: habitat is restricted to the open Pine Barrens of the southern portion of the state (Zappalorti et al. 1983). Ten radio-telemetered individuals tended to be found in dense vegetation that provided shade and moist, cool ground cover (Burger and Zappalorti 1988). Snakes were inactive 41% of the time, basked 36%, were moving 20%, and nested 3%. Selected habitat was primarily (93% of locations) pitch pine-scrub oak (<i>Quercus marilandica</i>) uplands (50-80% pine); Atlantic white cedar (<i>Chamaecyparis thyoides</i>) swamps and lowland pine areas were avoided. Snakes spent roughly equal amounts of time in human-altered and undisturbed habitats, with no major seasonal habitat shifts other than at nesting and hibernation. Early successional habitats in sites that had been previously disturbed by human activity appeared to be of crucial importance in both foraging and nesting (Zappalorti and Burger 1985). Habitat selection of radio-telemetered pine snakes differed appreciably from the apparent habitat selection of hand-captured or randomly encountered snakes (Burger and Zappalorti 1988). Thermoregulation appeared to be important in habitat selection. Snakes were inactive at very high and very low temperatures, when they remained under wet leaves or inside hollow logs. On windy days they sought cover in blueberry (<i>Vaccinium </i>spp.) patches and basked partially covered by vegetation, possibly to avoid dehydration (Burger and Zappalorti 1989). <br><br>Hibernacula and summer dens in New Jersey usually were beside old fallen logs, with entrance tunnels following decaying roots into soil. Snakes in hibernacula were at depths of 50-110 cm. Hibernacula were characterized by lower surface and soil temperature, higher surrounding leaf cover (mean = 55%), were closer to trees (mean = 130 cm), and had more trees within 10 m (mean = 138) than random points in clearings. In general, hibernacula were relatively more protected sites than random points and were less vulnerable to daily temperature fluctuations. Hibernacula appeared to have been excavated by the snakes themselves. Typically they had an average of eight side chambers and 642 cm of tunnels. Except for hatchlings, most snakes in hibernacula were located in individual chambers off the main tunnel and not in groups. All snakes were found at depths of 50 to 111 cm (mean = 79 cm). All hibernacula were within 100 m of nesting sites and most were only 10 to 15 m from nest chambers. See Burger et al. (1988) for further details. In New Jersey, eggs were deposited in nests as much as 25-30 cm deep. Nest sites often were re-used in subsequent years (Burger et al. 1988; Burger and Zappalorti 1991, 1992). Excavation took 2-4 days to complete and not all females that excavate nests were are gravid (Burger and Zappalorti 1991). Of 93 nest sites studied by Burger and Zappalorti (1986, 1991) all were located in large clearings with less than 10% tree cover in pitch pine-scrub oak xeric uplands. Nest sites were in soft sand in open, unvegetated sections of clearings, either recently cleared or burned areas with exposed sand. Clearings used for nesting averaged 166 m long and 79.2 m wide with slopes less than 14 degrees. Ground cover averaged less than 5% over the entire nest, less over the mouth and egg chamber. Nests were excavated in soft packed sand with little or no humus. Snakes appeared to select a particular range of sand hardness that provided ease of digging but was firm enough to avoid burrow collapse. Soil moisture may have been important in site selection (Burger and Zappalorti 1986, 1991). Nests ranged between 90-305 cm (mean = 187.6 cm) in length, averaged about 14 cm wide, and eggs were found at an average depth of about 21 cm below the surface. All nests were located in clearings or along roads or railroad beds. Clearings were usually man-made (only 1 or 20 clearings appeared to be naturally created by fire). Burger and Zappalorti (1986) suggested that man-made clearings were crucial to nesting ecology in the New Jersey Pine Barrens and may have improved nesting habitat for this population. <br><br>North Carolina: longleaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i>) sandhills (Brimley 1944). <br><br>South Carolina: Gibbons et al. (1991) described the habitat as sandy old fields and turkey oak (<i>Quercus laevis</i>)-pine forests. <br><br>Florida: subspecies <i>mugitus </i>is found in xeric sites, occurring primarily in longleaf pine-turkey oak woodlands, but also in sand pine (<i>Pinus clausa</i>) scrub, pine flatwoods on well-drained soils, and old fields on former sandhill sites (Franz 1992). Pine snakes seek out open habitats surrounded by wetlands during drought (Franz 1992). Franz (1992) also reported Florida pine snakes to actively seek burrows of gopher tortoises (<i>Gopherus polyphemus</i>) as shelter."
Coluber constrictor,"The habitat generally consists of humid wooded areas with abundant leaf litter and loose rocks; often the lizard occurs in the vicinity of springs, swamps, and bogs, but it also inhabits clearcuts, highway and powerline rights-of-way (Hulse et al. 2001), rocky bluffs above creek valleys, dry, rocky, south-facing hillsides (Johnson 2000), and dry shale barrens (West Virginia). Individuals often shelter under logs and rocks near water. Sometimes they take refuge in water. One nest was under a piece of shale (Mount 1975)."
Coluber flagellum,"Habitats include coastal dunes, sand pine scrub, longleaf pine-turkey oak woods, and xeric hammocks. This lizard is mostly fossorial; often under surface litter, also in pocket gopher burrows and mounds, burrowing beetle mounds; it occurs in greatest numbers where soil is sandy or gravelly and dry. It also occurs under rocks and tidal wrack on beaches. Eggs are laid in a cavity dug in sandy soil, several inches to 6 feet below the surface (Mount 1975)."
Crotalus adamanteus,"Habitats include wooded areas of many kinds, especially those that are humid, well-drained, supply abundant cover (rocks, logs, stumps, leaf litter), and have a patchy canopy; also seasonally flooded lowlands in some areas (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999). Most activity occurs on the ground, but these lizards also climb trees and are distinctly arboreal in Texas. Generally secretive, five-lined skinks spend much time under cover<br><br>Eggs are laid in or under rotting logs, stumps, or humus, or under rocks (Fitch 1954, Vogt 1981). In Ontario, preferred nest sites were large, moderately decayed logs with high substrate moisture (Hecnar 1994). Oviposition sites may be outside the non-nesting home range (Seburn 1993)."
Crotalus horridus,"The habitat of this terrestrial and arboreal species includes various situations such as wet pine flatwoods, cutover woodlots, cypress heads, scrub and sandhill (high pine) habitats, ridgetops, well-drained sandy places, seashore islands, and abandoned buildings. These skinks often are under or in ground litter, logs, piles of wood, or stumps, which appear to be important elements of the habitat (Mushinsky 1992, Anderson and Tiebout 1993). Eggs are laid in logs or stumps or under rocks or other cover."
Diadophis punctatus,"Rangewide, the species occupies wooded areas and woodland edges having diverse soil types and moisture conditions; hammocks and cypress heads in Florida; also swamps, vacant debris-strewn lots, and barrier islands. These lizards are semiarboreal and often sun themselves on snags or stumps; they take refuge in rotting stumps and standing dead trees, occupying old woodpecker holes and other hollows. On coastal islands in South Carolina, they prefer large live oaks having holes and a fringe of dense cover (bushes) (Cooper 1993); adults occur most often in oaks or on the ground, juveniles occur most often on walls, palmettos, or on the ground; they may actively avoid pines (Cooper and Vitt 1994). Eggs are laid in a nest in a rotting stump or dead tree or under rocks or other cover."
Drymarchon couperi,"This snake occurs only where crayfish are present and fairly abundant, generally in moderate to fast-flowing streams with ample cover, wooded or open conditions, and good exposure to sun. Habitat has been characterized as follows: streams with vegetation along the shoreline, and rocky (north) or sandy (south) bottoms (Gibbons and Dorcas 2004); clean streams or marshes of open areas or woodlands (Ernst and Ernst 2003); small clear creeks with rocky or dandy bottoms, stream impoundments (Alabama; Mount 1975); woodland streams and cypress domes (Florida; Tennant 1997); exposed rocky river shorelines (Arkansas; Trauth et al. 2004); shallow rocky streams in agricultural, urban, and forested areas (Virginia; Mitchell 1994); shallow streams and rivers with plenty of sun, rocks, and overhanging shrubs and small trees (North Carolina; Palmer and Braswell 1995); unpolluted rocky woodland streams (Illinois; Phillips et al. 1999); small rocky streams in wooded areas or open pastures, swampy woods (Kentucky; Barbour 1971); clear, spring-fed streams with moderate to fast currents and rocky bottoms, in lowland hardwood forests and shrub-carr communities (Wisconsin; Vogt 1981). In some areas the habitat may include slow-moving streams, ditches, canals, freshwater marshes, or the edges of ponds or lakes (Mitchell 1994, Harding 1997, Hulse et al. 2001, Gibbons and Dorcas 2004), but this species generally is uncommon or absent from these habitats (Palmer and Braswell 1995, Minton 2001). This snake basks on branches overhanging the water. Sometimes it travels on land away from water. Refuges include burrows, rocks, logs, and other cover."
Farancia abacura,"Habitat is mainly damp pine flatwoods; also slash pine and longleaf pine woodlands; habitat is maintained by periodic fire (Mount 1975, Dundee and Rossman 1989, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Tennant 1997, Ernst and Ernst 2003). Sometimes this snake is found in hardwood hammocks near pine flatwoods, along wooded edges of wet prairies, in sandhills near water, or in ecotones between sandhills and bottomlands and pocosins; some occur in dry live-oak woodlands on coastal islands off North Carolina and Florida (Ashton and Ashton 1981, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Ernst and Ernst 2003). This snake is secretive and fossorial, often occurring under loose bark, in or under rotting logs, stumps, leaf litter, or other debris, buried in sandy soil, or in burrows. During dry periods, it has been found in crayfish burrows. Eggs usually are laid in rotting wood (Martof et al. 1980)."
Farancia erytrogramma,"Habitats include sandy, easily burrowed soils (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999), such as dry upland hammocks and sand pine and longleaf pine-turkey oak sandhills (Ashton and Ashton 1985). The species is fossorial but may come above ground in September-October (Ashton and Ashton 1985). Worm lizards often are just beneath a leaf-mold layer in well-drained sandy soil, but reportedly they also can be common in plowed fields (Carr and Goin 1955). Eggs are laid underground."
Farancia erytrogramma erytrogramma,In most areas these lizards are arboreal in wooded landscapes. They usually occur in open/sunny situations.<br>
Haldea striatula,"This species occurs in a wide variety of habitats; generally it occurs in areas with ground cover (grass, leaf litter, forest floor debris, rocks, etc.), including dry upland woodlands as well as stream and pond edges (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999); often it can be found under ground surface cover. It goes underground in cold weather and may seek cover in water when pursued. Eggs are laid in moist humus, logs, rotting vegetation, or under rocks (Ashton and Ashton 1985, Minton 1972)."
Hemidactylus turcicus,"Habitats include wet prairies, wet savannas and pastures, palmetto-pine flatwoods, swamps, hardwood-dominated floodplains, sandhills, mixed pine-hardwood forest, hilly second-growth forests, scrub pinewoods, borders of cypress ponds, vicinity of lakes and marshes, and along rice-field canals and roadside ditches, generally in moist or wet lowlands (Werler and Dixon 2000, Ernst and Ernst 2003). This snake is mainly terrestrial; it shelters under surface cover (logs, stumps, thickets, etc.) or in animal burrows. It swims well; rarely climbs into vegetation."
Heterodon platirhinos,"This snake occurs in nearly all terrestrial and wetland habitat types in its range, including cities. Habitats in Mexico include cloud forest and tropical deciduous forest. Usually it inhabits moist situations, but it is not an aquatic species. It often occurs under debris or logs; frequently among water hyacinths in Florida. Hibernation sites (often communal) are underground or beneath buildings and other structures."
Heterodon simus,"Habitats are varied and include mountainous or hilly woodland/forest, upland meadows and valleys, and swamp and bog edges (Ernst and Ernst 2003). This snake shelters under and in ground cover, in building foundations, and in abandoned ant mounds. Generally it occurs in mesic situations with abundant ground cover."
Lampropeltis elapsoides,"Common near aquatic habitats: boggy areas, marshes, river-bottom swamps, vicinity of ponds and sloughs; also occurs in uplands such as hammocks and pineland-prairie region; common in parks and around homes near ponds and ditches; hides among water hyacinths, in water-edge debris, or under other cover (Conant and Collins 1991)."
Lampropeltis getula,"Habitat varies but tends to be relatively dry and wooded (often pine and oak), with an abundance of rocks, logs, or rotting stumps on the surface; specific examples of occupied habitats include xeric pine/oak woodland on hillsides and ridges; sandy pine flatwoods; maritime forests; sandhills; and sometimes mesic meadows, hardwood hammocks, and the wet margins of marshes, swamps, and rivers (Barbour 1971, Mount 1975, Ashton and Ashton 1981, Dunee and Rossman 1989, Mitchell 1994, Palmer and Braswell 1995, Tennant 1997, Minton 2001, Ernst and Ernst 2003). In daytime, this snake generally is under rocks, debris, or other surface cover, or within or under rotting logs or stumps. At night, it may be found on roads. Eggs are laid under woody debris, in rotting logs or sawdust piles, or underground."
Lampropeltis nigra,"Habitats include sandhills, sand pine scrub, coastal dunes, and xeric and mesic hammocks (Ashton and Ashton 1981, Ernst and Ernst 2003); it is more common in sandhills than in scrub habitat (Mushinsky and Witz 1993). In scrub habitat, this snake appears to most common in early successional stages generated by periodic disturbance (e.g., fire, clear cutting) that removes the matted understory or pine canopy (Campbell and Christman 1982). Fire periodicity evidently has no influence on local distribution in sandhill habitat (Mushinsky and Witz 1993). This secretive, fossorial snake is usually under the soil surface or under surface cover; it also uses pocket gopher mounds. "
Lampropeltis rhombomaculata,"Habitats include wet meadows, marshes, seasonally flooded prairies, bogs, ponds, lake shorelines, swamps, and shallow slow streams; also hardwood hammocks and other wet or moist forest in some areas; usually this snake is in or near vegetative cover (often shrubs or clumps of sedges or grasses) in sun-exposed sites along the edge of standing or flowing water; it climbs into low vegetation, rarely into tree canopy (Bishop and Farrell, 1994, Herpetol. Rev. 25:127; Rossman et al. 1996, Harding 1997, Ernst and Ernst 2003). Shelters include thick vegetation, muskrat lodges, or burrows. Hibernation sites are in burrows, ant mounds, underground on high ground (sometimes high on rocky slopes), or underwater."
Lampropeltis triangulum,"Throughout the range, common gartersnakes inhabit a very wide range of aquatic, wetland, and upland habitats; habitat preference exhibits rather pronounced regional differences (e.g., east vs. west). In some regions, such as much of eastern North America, these snakes are decidedly terrestrial and range far from water. In other areas, such as the Rocky Mountain region, they are mostly confined to riparian corridors.  When inactive, they occur underground, in or under surface cover, or in other secluded sites.<br><br>In some areas, common gartersnakes spend the cold winter months completely submerged in water. Submerged snakes retain more body water and conserve more stored energy than do snakes in dry sites. At the low temperatures of hibernation, the snake's metabolic rate is very low, so oxygen needs can be met even while the snake is submerged and unable to breathe air."
Liodytes alleni,"Habitats include deciduous woods, exposed rocky slopes in mixed deciduous-pine associations, pine woodland, grassy slopes with rocks in areas of deciduous forest, mesic hammocks, moist woodland along floodplains, wooded areas around marshes and other damp places, rocky sparse woods and forest edge, old fields, vacant lots, and wooded or brushy residential areas. In daytime, this secretive snake often shelters under logs, rocks, or other cover. It may aggregate during hibernation."
Liodytes pygaea,"Rivers, ponds, lakes, canals, large springs with overhanging foliage, marshes; all types of freshwater habitats in Florida. Sometimes in brackish water at stream mouths. Basks on sand bars and fallen logs. Often burrows into sand-mud bottom, leaving only head out. Eggs are laid in sandy, sunny areas near water. In Florida, a nest was in the sand apron of a recently abandoned gopher tortoise burrow, 103 m from the nearest body of water (Heinrich and Richardson, 1993, Herpetol. Rev. 24:31)."
Liodytes pygaea pygaea,"Habitat includes large rivers, river impoundments, lakes, ponds along rivers, pools along intermittent streams, bayous, oxbows; usually in areas with open sandy or mud banks and soft bottom. These turtles bask on shores or on partially submerged logs. Periods of inactivity are spent burrowed in bottom sediments in well-oxygenated sites. Eggs are laid in nests dug in open areas in sand, gravel, or soft soil near water."
Liodytes rigida,"Open sea to more than 500 miles from shore, mostly over continental shelf, and in bays, estuaries, lagoons, creeks, and mouths of rivers; mainly warm temperate and subtropical regions not far from shorelines. Off North Carolina, loggerheads inhabited waters of 13-28 C (available range 5-32 C) (Coles and Musick 2000). Adults occupy various habitats, from turbid bays to clear waters of reefs. Subadults occur mainly in nearshore and estuarine waters. Hatchlings move directly to sea after hatching, often float in masses of sea plants (Sargassum); may remain associated with sargassum rafts perhaps for 3-5 years. In Chesapeake Bay, occurs mainly in deeper channels, usually at river mouths or in the open bay. <br><br>Nesting occurs usually on open sandy beaches above high-tide mark, seaward of well-developed dunes. Nests primarily on high-energy beaches on barrier strands adjacent to continental land masses in warm temperate and subtropical regions; steeply sloped beaches with gradually sloped offshore approaches are favored (CSTC 1990). Renesting generally occurs at the same beach or within a few km; generally returns to the same area in subsequent years if habitat remains suitable. Individuals sometimes change to different nesting beach within a single nesting season; has changed to sites up to several hundred km away (see Eckert et al. 1989). Maximum hatching success and hatchling size occur when sand moisture level is about 25%. In Florida, nesting on urban beaches was strongly correlated with the presence of tall objects (trees, buildings), which apparently shield the beach from city lights (Salmon et al. 1995). See Garmestani et al. (2000) for information on nest-site selection in southwestern Florida."
Micrurus fulvius,"Feeding occurs in shallow, low-energy waters with abundant submerged vegetation, and also in convergence zones in the open ocean (NMFS and USFWS 2007). Migrations may traverse open seas. Adults are tropical in distribution, whereas juveniles range into temperate waters (e.g., see Morreale and Standora, no date). Hatchlings often float in masses of marine macroalgae (e.g., <i>Sargassum</i>) in convergence zones. Coral reefs and rocky outcrops near feeding pastures often are used as resting areas. Inactive individuals  may rest on the bottom in winter in the northern Gulf of California. Basking on beaches occurs in some areas (e.g., Hawaii). <br><br>Nesting occurs on beaches, usually on islands but also on the mainland. Sand may be coarse to fine, has little organic content; physical characteristics vary greatly in different regions. Most nesting occurs on high energy beaches with deep sand. At least in some regions, individuals generally nest at same beach (apparently the natal beach, Meylan et al. 1990, Allard et al. 1994) in successive nestings, though individuals sometimes change to a different nesting beach within a single nesting season (has switched to beach up to several hundred kilometers away) (see Eckert et al. 1989). Beach development and illumination often make beaches unsuitable for successful nesting."
Nerodia erythrogaster,"Snapping turtles occupy all types of freshwater habitats (streams, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, marshes, swamps), especially those with soft mud bottoms and abundant aquatic vegetation or submerged brush and logs. They occur in brackish water in some areas. Usually they are on the bottom but sometimes bask out of water, especially younger individuals and in far north. Hibernation occurs singly or in groups in streams, lakes, ponds, or marshes; in bottom mud, in or under submerged logs or debris, under overhanging bank, or in muskrat tunnel; often in shallow water; sometimes in anoxic sites (Brown and Brooks 1994, Herman et al. 1995). Nesting occurs in soft soil in open areas, often hundreds of meters from water (up to 181 m from permanent water in Michigan, Congdon et al. 1987), sometimes in muskrat houses."
Nerodia fasciata,"This species lives in slow-moving, shallow waters with soft bottoms such as rivers, streams, marshes, swamps, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs (Ernst and Lovich 2009). Aquatic vegetation and abundant basking sites are important habitat components (Ernst and Lovich 2009). They may colonize seasonally flooded areas near permanent water (Ernst and Lovich 2009). Nesting occurs in soft soil up to several hundred meters from water (Christens and Bider 1987, Congdon and Gatten 1989, Ernst and Lovich 2009). Some hatchlings remain in the nest in winter and emerge in spring (Packard and Packard 1995, Ernst and Lovich 2009). Adults estivate in water (Ernst and Lovich 2009)."
Nerodia floridana,"Spotted turtles inhabit mostly unpolluted, shallow bodies of water with a soft bottom and aquatic vegetation, such as small marshes, marshy pastures, bogs, fens, woodland streams, swamps, small ponds, vernal pools, and lake margins; in some areas they occur in brackish tidal streams.. Ponds surrounded by relatively undisturbed meadow or undergrowth are most favorable. These turtles favor waters with a soft bottom and aquatic vegetation. They often bask along the water's edge, on brush piles in water, or on logs or vegetation clumps. Often they move seasonally among different wetland types and may spend significant time on land during summer.<br/><br/>Cold season hibernation occurs in the muddy bottoms of waterways or bogs in communal hibernacula. Hibernacula usually have water depths of 55 to 95 cm (22 to 37 in) with a slow but steady flow or drift of water through densely vegetated wetlands with a deep, soft, mucky substrate (Carroll, pers. comm.). Muskrat burrows in Pennsylvania were used as winter hibernacula, nocturnal sleeping sites, refugia from danger, and estivation sites during the warm dry months (Ernst 1976). In Massachusetts, radio-tagged individuals hibernated in red maple-sphagnum swamps, then moved in late March to upland vernal pools, where they spent 3-4 months, then left the pools in August and spent 4-14 days in secluded terrestrial sites, then completed the move back to the swamps in August (Graham 1995). Hibernation occurred exclusively in bogs in central Ontario (Haxton and Berrill 1999) and in sphagnum swamps on an island in Georgian Bay, Ontario (Litzgus and Brooks 2000). See Lewis and Ritzenthaler (1997) for characteristics of hibernacula and hibernacula use in a fen in Ohio. Litzgus and Brooks (2000) documented seasonal changes in habitat selection in Ontario. <br/><br/>Eggs are laid in well-drained soil of marshy pastures, in grass or sedge tussock or mossy hummocks, in open areas (e.g., dirt path or road) at edge of thick vegetation, or similar sites exposed to sun. Sandy, sparsely vegetated strips and washouts along agricultural field edges are favorable for nesting (Carroll, pers. comm.). In South Carolina, gravid females spent a considerable amount of time on or at the edge of a powerline right-of-way, and they nested on the edge of the powerline and in relatively recent clearcuts (Litzgus and Mousseau 2004).<br/><br/>New Hampshire: deep-muck, densely vegetated scrub-shrub swamp or emergent marsh habitats that are edgewaters or backwaters of low-gradient reaches of permanent streams with moderate to slow flowages, and water depth of 10 to 50 cm (Carroll, pers. comm.). Rhode Island: reported from salt marshes and small bogs or ponds with adjacent dry upland oak-pine forest (DeGraaf and Rudis 1983). Florida: woodland or meadow streams with sphagnum. Indiana: thoroughly aquatic, said to inhabit bogs by Smith (1961); also has been collected in shallow inlets of lakes, grassy marshes, drainage ditches, and woodland ponds, and is rarely found in flowing water (Minton 1972). Maine: unpolluted, small, shallow wetlands surrounded by dense vegetation such as slow streams, ponds, vernal pools, bog ponds, roadside ditches, and wet meadows (Hunter et al. 1992). Vermont: areas of highbush blueberry/red maple swamps, and in kettle basin shrub swamps (Fichtel, pers. comm.)."
Nerodia sipedon,"Shallow ponds and lakes with thick vegetation, cypress swamps, ditches, temporary pools; usually not in flowing water. Wanders overland, especially in spring. In Virginia, inhabits interdunal swales that have seasonal water fluctuations; some leave drying wetlands and estivate on land in summer (Buhlmann 1995). Hibernates in mud and aquatic vegetation along lake margins or in terrestrial situations (Buhlmann 1995), up to at least 165 m from wetlands (Buhlmann and Gibbons 2001). Eggs are laid in soil in an open area near water."
Nerodia taxispilota,"Marine; open ocean, often near edge of continental shelf; also seas, gulfs, bays, and estuaries. Mainly pelagic, seldom approaching land except for nesting (Eckert 1992). Concentrates in summer in waters mostly 20-40 m deep near Cape Canaveral, Florida. Dives almost continuously, to depths of up to at least several thousand meters; may linger at the surface at midday but spends most of time submerged. <br><br>Nests on sloping sandy beaches backed up by vegetation, often near deep water and rough seas. Largest colonies use continental, rather than insular, beaches (CSTC 1990). Absence of a fringing reef appears to be important. Deposits eggs in moist sand. Individuals sometimes change to different nesting beach between nestings during a single year; changed to sites 30-110 km away in West Indies (Eckert et al. 1989; see also Keinath and Musick 1993). May rapidly occupy newly formed nesting habitat (Pritchard 1992)."
Opheodrys aestivus,"Bog turtles inhabit slow, shallow, muck-bottomed rivulets of sphagnum bogs, calcareous fens, marshy/sedge-tussock meadows, spring seeps, wet cow pastures, and shrub swamps; the habitat usually contains an abundance of sedges or mossy cover. The turtles depend on a mosaic of microhabitats for foraging, nesting, basking, hibernation, and shelter (USFWS 2000). ""Unfragmented riparian systems that are sufficiently dynamic to allow the natural creation of open habitat are needed to compensate for ecological succession"" (USFWS 2000). Beaver, deer, and cattle may be instrumental in maintaining the essential open-canopy wetlands (USFWS 2000).<br /><br />Bog turtles commonly bask on tussocks in the morning in spring and early summer. They burrow into soft substrate of waterways, crawls under sedge tussocks, or enter muskrat burrows during periods of inactivity in summer (see Bury 1979).<br /><br />In Pennsylvania, bog turtles hibernated mainly in water and mud in muskrat burrows, and in mud bottom of marsh rivulets under 5-15 cm of water.<br /><br />In New Jersey, hibernacula were in subterranean rivulets or seepage areas where water flowed continuously from underground springs; turtles were under 5-55 cm of water and mud (see Ernst et al. [1989] for further details).<br /><br />In Maryland, larger population sizes were associated with sites with the following characteristics: circular basin with spring-fed pockets of shallow water, bottom substrate of soft mud and rock, dominant vegetation of low grasses and sedges, and interspersed wet and dry pockets; winter retreats were shallow, just below upper surface of frozen mud and/or ice (Chase et al. 1989). Studies in Maryland and Pennsylvania noted use of the lower portion of wetlands for overwintering.<br /><br />In Virginia, selected habitats included wet meadow, smooth alder edge, and bulrush; dry meadow and streams were avoided (Carter et al. 1999).<br /><br />Nests are in open and elevated ground in areas of moss, sedges, or moist earth (see Bury 1979). The turtles dig a shallow nest or lay eggs in the top of a sedge tussock."
Ophisaurus attenuatus,"Commonly occupies habitats with a well-drained sandy substrate, ample herbaceous vegetation for food, and sunlit areas for nesting (Hallinan 1923, Landers 1980, Landers et al. 1980, Diemer 1989). These habitat types include sandhill (pine-turkey oak), sand pine scrub, xeric hammock, pine flatwoods, dry prairie, coastal grasslands and dunes, and mixed hardwood-pine communities (Landers and Speake 1980, Auffenberg and Franz 1982, Kushlan and Mazzotti 1984, Diemer 1986, 1992a). Prefers open habitats that support a wide variety of herbaceous ground cover vegetation for forage; usually abandons densely canopied areas and frequently can be found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fence-rows, old fields, and the edges of overgrown (unburned) uplands (see Diemer 1989, Stewart et al. 1993, Breininger et al. 1994). Upland habitats with extensive canopies reduce the amount of direct sunlight on the ground which may hamper tortoises from reaching minimum thermal requirements for normal daily activities. Also, excessive shade decreases herbaceous vegetation essential for growth, development, and reproduction (Mushinsky and McCoy 1994).<br /><br />Temporarily abandons marginal habitats during periods of drought; increasing habitat isolation eventually may result in marginal habitats being completely abandoned (Matthews and Moseley 1990). In Georgia, adults congregated on droughty sites in early spring, and many moved to more mesic soils for autumn-winter (McRae et al. 1981).<br /><br />Densities of gopher tortoises are known to be relatively high in sandhill communities, however, high densities may not be indicative of a healthy population (Mushinsky and McCoy 1994). Mushinsky and McCoy (1994) reported that high densities of some tortoise populations may be the result of tortoises confined to a true or ""habitat"" island. Tortoises in this situation are unable to move freely to new locations as the quality of the habitat degenerates. More research is needed on the demography of tortoises in confined areas.<br /><br />Gopher tortoises are highly fossorial and construct extensive burrow systems. They spend much of the time underground. See ecology section for further information on burrows.<br /><br />Eggs are deposited in a typical flask-shaped nest cavity excavated by the hindlimbs of the female to a depth of about 10-15 cm. Nests may be located in any open sunny area near the burrow of the female, but most often, nests are placed in the spoil mound immediately outside the female's burrow (e.g., Hallinan 1923, Allen and Neil 1951, Arata 1958, Mount 1975, Landers et al. 1980, Butler and Hull 1996)."
Ophisaurus attenuatus longicaudus,"Alluvial and spring-fed rivers and associated waters (e.g., river swamps, impoundments); clear limestone-bottomed streams with an abundance of fallen trees and mollusks. Inactive at night on submerged limbs just beneath water surface. Rests on bottom in limestone depressions when water becomes cold. Often basks on logs. Buries eggs in sand at water's edge."
Ophisaurus compressus,"Slow rivers and lakes with mud bottoms, basking logs, and abundant aquatic vegetation. Often in mill ponds, oxbows, and river overflow ponds. In Kansas, occurred exclusively in small shady streams over rock and gravel substrate (Fuselier and Edds 1994). May occupy burrows in banks when inactive (Minton 1972). Wintering sites include river bottoms (e.g., in hollows, among rocks or other objects) (e.g., see Graham and Graham, 1992, Can. Field-Nat. 106:517-519; Graham et al. 2000); in Vermont, 7 of 15 monitored adult females hibernated in the same site in two consecutive years (Graham et al. 2000). Basks on muskrat houses, logs, etc. Eggs are laid in nest dug in soft soil or sand, generally away from beaches (Ernst and Barbour 1972)."
Ophisaurus mimicus,"Medium-sized rivers to large creeks with sand bars and sandy banks, logs and other basking sites, deep pools, and abundant mollusks (Behler and King 1979, Lovich and McCoy 1992, Ernst and Lovich 2009). Eggs are laid in nests dug in sand bars and sandy banks (Ernst and Lovich 2009)."
Ophisaurus ventralis,"Cypress swamps, sloughs, ponds, drainage canals, wet meadows, shallow marshes, and adjacent forest areas; wanders on dry land and enters brackish ponds (e.g., in the Florida Keys; Dunson 1981). Often observed on roads and along canal banks (Carr 1940, Duellman and Schwartz 1958). Sometimes digs into decaying vegetation or soil surface. In central Florida, sometimes estivates on land when water levels are low; returns to water after rains raise water levels (Wygoda 1979). May less aquatic in the north than in southern Florida, where habitats more often include deeper flowing waters and where estivation on land is rare or absent (Ernst et al. 1972, Iverson 1979). However, in the lower Florida Keys, habitats include shallow ponds and excavated mosquito control ditches, and turtles may use terrestrial retreats if the ponds dry or become too saline (Dunson 1992). <br /><br />Eggs are laid in nests dug in sand or decaying vegetation (Ernst and Barbour 1972, Iverson 1979). Sometimes oviposits in alligator nests. Nesting areas in Florida include turkey oak-longleaf pine sandhills adjacent to swamps; may travel up to at least 50-100 meters to nest (Mushinsky and Wilson 1992). After ovipositing, females often burrow underground a few meters from the nest, and then move back to wetland habitat after the next rain (Wilson, unpubl.)."
Pantherophis alleghaniensis,"Shallow, slow- or nonflowing fresh or brackish water with soft bottom and abundant aquatic vegetation; also wet meadows. Frequently travels overland. Basically a bottom-dweller. Occupies various aquatic or terrestrial sites (up to at least 135 meters from wetlands; Buhlmann and Gibbons 2001) when inactive. Eggs are laid in a nest dug in an open area in soft soil not far from water; also in and under vegetable and other debris and in muskrat tunnels (Ernst and Barbour 1972). See Bodie et al. (1996) for information on nest site selection. Hatchlings may overwinter in nest. <br/><br/>In South Carolina, terrestrial nesting forays lasted 2-29 days (mean 9 days); gravid females left water, buried themselves, usually stayed buried until a rainstorm occurred, nested during a rainstorm, buried themselves again after nesting, and later returned to the water, usually when another rainstorm occurred (Burke et al. 1994)."
Pantherophis guttatus,"Habitat of adults primarily includes shallow coastal and estuarine waters, often over sandy or muddy bottoms where crab are numerous. Most adults stay in the Gulf of Mexico, and they are rare along the Atlantic coast of the northeastern United States. Apparently most activity is benthic. Post-hatchlings spend 1-4 years as surface pelagic drifters in weedlines of offshore currents in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean, then shift to benthic coastal habitats of various types, especially where crabs and other invertebrates are numerous (CSTC 1990, NMFS and USFWS 2007).<br><br>Nesting occurs on well-defined elevated dune areas, especially on beaches backed up by large swamps or bodies of open water having seasonal, narrow ocean connections."
Pantherophis spiloides,"Habitat: freshwater (lakes, quiet rivers)."
Phrynosoma cornutum,"Habitat consists of slow-moving, deep water of rivers, sloughs, oxbows, and canals or lakes associated with rivers (e.g., large impoundments including reservoirs) (Ernst et al. 1994); also swamps, bayous, and ponds near rivers, and shallow creeks that are tributary to occupied rivers, sometimes including swift upland streams (Phelps 2004). This turtle sometimes enters brackish waters near river mouths. Usually it occurs in water with a mud bottom and some aquatic vegetation but uses sand-bottomed river and creeks in Florida (P. Moler, pers. comm., 2020). Within streams, alligator snapping turtles may occur under or in logjams, beneath undercut banks, under rock shelters, or in deep holes (Jensen et al. 2008). These turtles are highly aquatic and rarely are found out of water (except during nesting). In Tennessee, F. Scott (pers. comm., 1992) most often found radio-tagged turtles in less than 3 meters of water. In northeast Louisiana, Sloan and Taylor (1987) found that native turtles preferred flotant (dense floating vegetation mat) with cypress or buttonbush habitat. The turtles frequently used openings in the flotant beneath cypress trees. In the same region, Harrel et al. (1996) documented a preference for bald cypress forest by subadults; most occupied sites were associated with logs. In Missouri, higher abundance was associated with submerged physical structures, deeper water, higher levels of detritus, and warmer water (Lescher et al. 2013).<br /><br />Ewert (1976) provided a description of nesting habitat. He observed 16 nests from the Apalachicola River, Florida, and one from Lake Iamonia which adjoins the Ochlockonee River, Florida. The turtles chose a variety of situations for nesting, from sand mounds along the river banks to sandbars within the stream, to a 1.5 m high steep cut bank. Conditions at the Apalachicola sites included xeric exposed sites (three nests), more mesic sites with trees nearby but open above (three nests), partially shaded sites (4 nests), and deeply shaded sites (six nests, one well within a three to five m cane stand with a completely closed canopy). Ewert suggested that many of the turtles emerged from quiet backwaters of the flooded forest, rather than the river proper. The Apalachicola nests' distance from the nearest water averaged 12 m. The one nest on an island in Lake Iamonia was in the open and was 72 m from the nearest water. Ewert and Jackson (1994) expanded this data set but not greatly altered these proportions. Jackson and Jensen (2003) reported nest sites that were about 30 and 70 m from streams."
Pituophis melanoleucus,"Coastal marshes, tidal flats, coves, estuaries, and lagoons behind barrier beaches; brackish and salt water (but basically retricted to estuarine situations; intolerant of long-term exposure to freshwater or 100% salt water). Burrows into mud when inactive (Ernst and Barbour 1972); in Virginia, has been observed hibernating in moist sand 8 m from the high tide mark. May venture into grassy lowlands at high tide (Ashton and Ashton 1985). Hatchlings move to the closest terrestrial vegetation after emergence from nest. Small individuals may use cover of tidal wrack and dense mats of vegetation (Lovich et al. 1991). In Maryland, adult females moved farther from shore and spent more time in deeper water than did males, and juveniles remained near shore in shallow water (Roosenburg et al. 1999). <br /><br />Eggs are laid in a nest dug in sandy marsh edge, offshore island, or dune (vegetated or unvegetated), above high tide mark (e.g., see Feinberg and Burke 2003). Nests of different females may be dispersed or aggregated."
Pituophis melanoleucus melanoleucus,"Streams with moderate current, abundant aquatic vegetation, basking sites, and rocky bottom; also lakes, ponds, oxbows, swamps, large ditches, lagoons, brackish tidal marshes; leaves water only to nest or bask (Ernst and Barbour 1972). <br><br>Eggs are laid in nests dug in sandy soil usually less than about 30 m from water (Ernst and Barbour 1972)."
Pituophis melanoleucus mugitus,"Large ponds, lakes, spring runs, canals, sluggish rivers; areas with abundant aquatic vegetation, soft bottom, and basking sites. Burrows in mud in winter. Generally sleeps on bottom or among aquatic plants at night. Wanders on land. Eggs are laid in nests dug in soft soil in open areas. See Bodie et al. (1996) for information on nest site selection."
Plestiodon anthracinus,"This species is a generalist, inhabiting ponds, lakes, ditches, canals, sloughs, rivers, spring runs, cypress swamps, marshes, and mangrove-bordered creeks (Ernst and Lovich 2009). It appears to prefer areas with water lilies (<i>Nymphaea</i> sp.) over emergent grassy vegetation (Jackson 2006)."
Plestiodon anthracinus anthracinus,N/A
Plestiodon anthracinus pluvialis,"Inhabits virtually any permanent body of freshwater having a slow current and soft bottom. May bask on tree limbs well above water. Hibernates in bottom mud or debris, under rocks, or in holes in banks; may congregate when hibernating. Eggs are laid up to about 50 m (average 7 m in Pennsylvania) from water in soil; under logs, stumps, and vegetable debris; and in walls of muskrat houses; sometimes on open ground. Hatchlings may overwinter in nest."
Plestiodon egregius,N/A
Plestiodon egregius similis,"Eastern box turtles inhabit forests, fields, forest-brush, and forest-field ecotones. In some areas they move seasonally from fields in spring to forest in summer. They commonly enters pools of shallow water in summer. For shelter, they burrow into loose soil, debris, mud, old stump holes, or under leaf litter. They can successfully hibernate in sites that may experience subfreezing temperatures. In Maryland bottomland forest, some hibernated in pits or depressions in forest floor (usually about 30 cm deep) usually within summer range; individuals tended to hibernate in same area in different years (Stickel 1989).<br/><br/>Egg laying sites often are sandy or loamy soils in open areas; females may move from bottomlands to warmer and drier sites to nest. In Maryland, females used the same nesting area in different years (Stickel 1989)."
Plestiodon fasciatus,"Usually in quiet water with abundant aquatic vegetation, soft bottom, and basking sites. Hibernates underwater or in protected places near waterline (Ernst and Barbour 1972). More tolerant of pollution than are most turtles. Eggs are laid in nests dug in soft damp soil in open areas. Nesting area may be on nearest suitable site or far from water (usually the former) (Ernst and Barbour 1972). In Costa Rica, some females briefly enter the sea and nest on Caribbean Sea beaches (upper beach berm usually under cocoplum vegetation; hatchlings probably do not enter the sea (Moll 1994)."
Plestiodon inexpectatus,"Habitat is primarily darkly stained, sluggish, weedy lowland creeks, small to medium rivers (including backwaters), ponds, lakes, and swamps, usually with mud, silt, or detritus substrates (Page and Burr 2011)."
Plestiodon laticeps,"Shortnose sturgeons inhabit rivers, estuaries, and the sea (Wilk and Silverman 1976); usually they are most abundant in estuaries, generally within a few miles of land when at sea. ""Adult use of salt water varies with latitude and may reflect bioenergetic adaptations to latitudinal differences between fresh and saltwater habitats for thermal and foraging suitability"" (Kynard 1996). ""Dam-locked"" populations have been reported for the Connecticut River (only the population above Holyoke Dam reproduces successfully) and South Carolina (not verified). Shortnose sturgeons reportedly prefer deep pools with soft substrates and vegetated bottoms, but individuals may vary in preference for various water depths and substrate types (Seibel 1991). <br><br>Adults have separate summer and winter areas. In the Merrimack and Connecticut rivers, they tend to concentrate in areas where natural or artificial features cause a decrease in river flow (Kiefer and Kynard 1996). Adults may move to deeper water of lakes, lower rivers, bays, or ocean for winter. In the Savannah River, the freshwater/saltwater boundary region was used by adults and juveniles in both fall and winter (Hall et al. 1991). A later study in the Savannah River (Collins et al. 2002) found that no juveniles were recorded as far downriver as the nursery area identified by Hall et al. (1991), perhaps as a result of changes caused by harbor modifications.<br><br>Shortnose sturgeons in southern waters tend to exhibit limited distributions during the summer within habitats at the saltwater/freshwater interface (Flournoy et al. 1992, Rogers and Weber 1995a). Therefore, estuarine habitat at the salt/fresh interface constitutes critical habitat in southern river systems (Collins et al., in press). <br><br>Spawning occurs generally well upriver from summer foraging and nursery grounds. In South Carolina, spawning areas include flooded hardwood swamps along rivers. In the Savannah River, spawned in areas characterized by submerged timber, scoured sand, and a clay and gravel substrate, with depths of 6-9 m and bottom velocities averaging 82 cm/sec; a probable nursery area was about 2-5 km downriver from the freshwater/saltwater boundary and was characterized by sandy-mud and clay-mud bottom at a depth of 10-14 m (Hall et al. 1991). Spawning in the Merrimack and Connecticut rivers occurs in rubble boulder substrate (Kynard, 1997). In the Altamaha River, spawning is reported to occur exclusively near limestone outcrops (Rogers and Weber, 1995b). Generally, shortnose sturgeons spawn in sand to boulder sized substrate with low-medium water flow (0.2-1.8 m/sec). Larvae and juveniles have been reported from and may prefer deep river channels (Richmond and Kynard 1995) above the salt wedge. <br><br>Laboratory studies indicate that newly hatched larvae go through a 2-day downstream migration to riverine habitats where they remain for approximately one year (Kynard 1997). A resumption of downstream movement resumes the following spring at which time yearlings appear in samples of estuarine habitats, completing downstream migration from spawning areas. The timing of downstream movements likely varies among population segments with latitudinal variation in temperature regimes. <br><br>Juveniles are found in the saltwater/freshwater interface of a river in deep, cool channels with sand-silt substrate. They occur in the lower salinity waters of this interface in the summer (Pottle and Dadswell 1979)."
Regina septemvittata,"Primary habitat is the bottoms of large, clean, freshwater rivers and lakes (Hocutt and Wiley 1986, Becker 1983), although the species rarely occurs in the brackish water of the lower St. Lawrence River and the Moose River near James Bay (Scott and Crossman 1973). Preferred substrates include firm sand, gravel, or rock (Pflieger 1975). In the Great Lakes, <i>A. fulvescens</i> lives primarily in shoal water. Lakes sturgeons are found most often at depths of 5-10 meters (COSEWIC 2006), but larger fish occasionally have been taken at depths of up to 43 meters (Harkness and Dymond 1961, Scott and Crossman 1973). In rivers, preferred habitat is deep mid-river areas and pools, where water depths vary between four and nine meters and food is abundant (Harkness and Dymond 1961, Priegel and Wirth 1977). In the Mississippi and Missouri rivers in Missouri (Pflieger 1997), habitat is characterized by river channels developed in deep deposits of gravel, sand, and silt, possessing numerous islands, side channels, and backwaters (Pflieger 1989); a continuous strong flow coupled with one or two periods of sustained flooding is also indicative of this habitat; gradients are generally less than 1 foot per mile. <br><br>In rivers, spawning occurs in water generally 0.3-4.7 meters deep, typically in areas of swift currents, rapids, or waterfalls that prevent upstream migration (Scott and Crossman 1973, Priegel and Wirth 1971, Harkness and Dymond 1961). Spawning sites in the Wolf River of Wisconsin typically occur on the outside bends of river banks, particularly where upwelling currents and substrates of boulders, rocks, or slabs of concrete have been riprapped at a steep angle (Priegel and Wirth 1971). Spawning substrate varies from hard-pan clay to gravel to boulders, including riprap that has been placed along river edges (LaHaye et al. 1992, COSEWIC 2006). In rivers, larvae drift downstream. In lakes, spawning occurs over rocky ledges or shoals where wave action produces sufficient oxygen levels for the eggs. No nest is constructed; eggs and milt are scattered over the bottom where fertilized eggs adhere to rocks.<br><br>Young sturgeons travel in large schools over gravel areas and sand bars during the fall months of their first year. After the first year, the young inhabit the same areas as older fish, as described above (Becker 1983)."
Rhadinaea flavilata,"Primarily marine, but close to shore, when not breeding; migrates to rivers for spawning, moves downstream afterward (may stay upstream in winter in some northern areas).<br/><br/>Telemetered adults in Choctawhatchee Bay area, Florida, usually were in nearshore waters 2-4 m deep in winter and spring; individuals usually remained within small areas (which typically had sandy substrate containing benthic crustaceans and annelids) for several weeks but sometimes moved long distances (Fox et al. 2002). Most males stayed in the Bay whereas most females were in the Gulf of Mexico or could not be detected. <br/><br/>Juveniles spend winter and spring mainly in river mouths. In some rivers, juveniles may spend several years continuously in freshwater; in others, they may move downstream to brackish water when temperatures drop in the fall (Hoff 1980). <br/><br/>Spawns in fresh water (sometimes tidal) usually over bottom of hard clay, rubble, gravel, or shell. May spawn in brackish water. In the Pee Dee River, South Carolina, has been reported as spawning in relatively slow current in turbid water over substrates of sand and silt (see Gilbert 1989)."
Rhineura floridana,"Adults and subadults ascend tropical and subtropical streams, often to headwaters; they occur (but may be rare) in pools and runs of small to medium rivers (Page and Burr 2001); adults occur mainly in the upper parts of clear tributaries that have strong currents and rocky bottoms (Miller 2005). Young occur at sea and have been found drifting in currents hundreds of miles from shore; they also occur in lower river courses (Miller 2005). Spawning occurs at sea (catadromous)."
Sceloporus undulatus,"Habitat includes typically clear, cool and warm, moderate gradient, small to medium upland rivers; typically this species is caught in shallow water (0.5-2 meters) with little current, over clean gravel and rubble (sometimes with a slight silt overlay) in sluggish pool margins just above or below riffles, often under or near slab-rock boulders, particularly in or near stands of water willow (<i>Justicia</i>) or sometimes near cut banks (Lee et al. 1980, Etnier and Starnes 1993, Jenkins and Burkhead 1994). Eggs are laid possibly on the sides of boulders or water willow stems (Etnier and Starnes 1993). Shepard and Burr (1984) described ideal habitats as clear pools with eddies over silt-free sand or gravel substrates with adequate cover, boulders, snags, or water willow (<i>Justicia </i>sp.) beds."
Scincella lateralis,"Habitat includes riverine, estuarine, and Atlantic coastal waters; also in certain lakes and reservoirs in the southeastern United States. Adults occur in saltwater except during the breeding season; they occur up to at least 200 km  offshore. Juveniles move to sea when about 1 month old.<br><br>Spawning occurs in fresh or brackish water, in tidally influenced portions of coastal rivers (Bozeman and Van Den Avyle 1989). According to Lee et al. 1980, spawning occurs in deep swift water over hard substrates. According to Bozeman and Van Den Avyle 1989, spawning occurs in shallow areas covered with vegetation, old rice fields, and river swamps and small tributaries above tidal influence. Eggs sink and adhere to objects on the bottom (Scott and Crossman 1973); after a few hours the eggs unstick and drift downstream (Dadswell 1980). Larvae occur in or slightly downstream from spawning areas; juveniles may exhibit net upstream movement until emigration from freshwater in summer or fall (or, in some areas, the next spring) (Fay et al. 1983). Nursery areas in the Neuse River, North Carolina, were characterized by deep, black water draining hardwood swamps, with little salinity or current and with a mud or detritus bottom (Bozeman and Van Den Avyle 1989)."
Sistrurus miliarius,"This is an anadromous fish; adults live in saltwater and migrate into medium to large coastal rivers to spawn. Mettee et al. (1996) stated that actual spawning has not been observed but probably occurs in open, flowing water over sand bars in late afternoon or at night. In northwestern Florida, spawning occurs at 19-22 C in moderate current over coarse sand and gravel (Laurence and Yerger 1966, Mills 1972). In Missouri, young were captured in swift water about rock wing dikes in the Osage River and over rocky shoals having noticeable current in the Gasconade River. <br><br>"
Storeria dekayi,"Habitat includes clear to moderately turbid medium to large rivers and large reservoirs; usually in current over sand and gravel; occasionally occurs in coastal brackish or marine waters (Robins and Ray 1986, Page and Burr 2011). <br><br>Spawning occurs probably in deep water of main channels over bars of coarse sand or gravel (Lee et al. 1980)."
Storeria occipitomaculata,"Adults live in saltwater except during the breeding season. Juveniles move from rivers to saltwater by fall or early winter; may linger in lower rivers, sounds, and bays before migrating to the sea. Spawning occurs as far as 200 km upstream from estuaries in creeks, ponds, lakes, and backwaters along major river courses (Manooch 1984), often in tidal freshwater areas."
Storeria victa,"Marine waters or open lake waters except during breeding season. Lake populations overwinter in deep water. See Fay et al. (1983) for details on various specific environmental requirements. Marine populations spawn in quiet portions of rivers (fresh or brackish water) or in small streams, in lagoons behind barrier beaches, or in lakes above influence of tide. Lake populations move into shallow inshore waters or ponds to spawn at night. Larvae occur in or slightly downstream from spawning areas; juveniles may exhibit net upstream movement until leaving freshwater/estuarine nursery areas in summer or fall (or, in some areas, in spring of the next year)."
Tantilla coronata,"Adults occur in marine waters except during the breeding season. Larvae summer in rivers, enter sea by fall; return to fresh water when mature. Premigratory juveniles appear to be habitat generalists, whereas earlier life stages and spawning adults are more selective (Ross et al. 1993). <br><br>Spawning occurs in various habitats (often in runs) in rivers as far as 480 km upstream from river mouth (but now usually prevented from moving so far upstream by dams). See Ross et al. (1993) for an evaluation of habitat suitability index models for riverine life stages."
Tantilla relicta,"This bass occurs in brushy and vegetated pools of creeks and small to medium rivers with low turbidity and substrates of mud, sand, or gravel (Page and Burr 1991). In upland areas, substrates are primarily gravel and rubble. "
Tantilla relicta neilli,"Habitat includes pools and brushy margins in creeks and small to medium rivers (Page and Burr 2011). This bass prefers small, cool, weedy lakes or littoral regions of larger lakes, and streams with typically rocky, always silt-free substrates, permanent flow, low turbidity, and extensive cover (Lee et al. 1980). Spawning occurs in shallow water in shallow depressions made by males in areas as diverse as swamps and gravel shoals; nests may be close together (Scott and Crossman 1973)."
Thamnophis saurita,"This bullhead typically occurs in streams with hard rocky bottoms and moderate to swift current; in holes, flowing pools, runs, and often in riffles; rarely in backwaters (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011)."
Thamnophis sirtalis,"This catfish inhabits sluggish lower reaches of coastal streams, sloughs, warmwater lakes, reservoirs, farm ponds, and tidal freshwater estuaries; it requires water above 20 C in summer. Spawning occurs over saucer-shaped nests cleared on the bottom by males and females."
Virginia valeriae,"This catfish occurs in ponds, small lakes, river backwaters, swamps, impoundments, and stream pools, in areas with warm and turbid water, muddy bottoms, slow currents, and few other fish species. Adults tend to be inactive in schools in aquatic vegetation during daylight hours. Eggs are laid in shallow nests made by females on the bottom in mud or sand, in secluded areas such as under logs or mats of aquatic vegetation (Sublette et al. 1990); adults fan water over the eggs."
Apalone ferox,"This bullhead occurs in shallow, soft-bottomed, weedy parts of clear warm lakes, ponds, reservoirs, or slow-moving streams or canals. It is more tolerant of pollution than are most other ictalurids. Eggs are laid in saucer-shaper depressions beside or beneath banks, logs, or tree roost, or in burrows or under debris on the bottom (Becker 1983)."
Apalone spinifera,"Habitat includes ponds, lakes, sluggish creeks and small to large rivers, sloughs, backwaters, and reservoirs. Usually this bullhead occurs in vegetated shallows over sand, rock, mud, or silt (most often soft substrates), in clear to turbid water (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). It may burrow into soft bottoms and become inactive in winter. Eggs are laid in open excavations in sand, gravel, or (rarely) mud, often in shelter of logs, rocks, or vegetation, or in holes, burrows, or debris. Nest made by one or both sexes usually are around shores or in coves or creek mouths."
Caretta caretta,"Adults usually are in slow-water areas of small to large rivers (sometimes large creeks) with soft mud, muck, sand, or rock bottoms covered with organic detritus (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Younger individuals tend to be in smaller clearer streams.(Jenkins and Burkhead 1994). This bullhead also occurs in lakes, ponds, and impoundments."
Chelonia mydas,"This bullhead prefers deep holes of small to medium rivers with slow to swift currents and rock substrates or sand bottoms; it also occurs over mud bottoms, typically near stumps, in impoundments (Lee et al. 1980, Boschung and Mayden 2004, Page and Burr 2011). This species thrives is various types of habitats (Boschung and Mayden 2004)."
Chelydra serpentina,"Habitat includes swampy vegetated sloughs and backwaters of lowland streams and bays of warm clear lakes (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). One was found estivating in a moist chamber on land along a river floodplain (Scott and Crossman 1973). Eggs are laid in nests in areas cleared of vegetation or under logs, stumps, or bushes (Scott and Crossman 1973)."
Chrysemys picta,"Habitat includes clear to tannin-stained streams with shifting sand bottoms and moderate to swift current; most often this species occurs in moderate current in moderate to large streams, but occasionally it enters small streams (Lee et al. 1980, Boschung and Mayden 2004) . It is most common at depths of 2-4 feet (Williams 1975). "
Clemmys guttata,"Habitat includes lower freshwater and estuarine reaches of coastal rivers, bays, sounds, and high salinity nearshore marine waters; usually it occurs in shallow waters, at depths of less than 20 meters."
Deirochelys reticularia,"Spawning occurs apparently in the Sargasso Sea, a large portion of the western Atlantic Ocean east of the Bahamas and south of Bermuda. Spawning has never been directly observed, and suitable conditions for it remain speculative. Larvae drift and swim in prevailing currents (Antilles Current, Florida Current, and Gulf Stream) that take them to areas near continental coasts or continental slope waters. Glass eels and elvers enter estuaries. Some elvers travel upstream to spend the majority of their life growing as yellow eels in rivers, streams, ponds, and the shallow, more productive areas of lakes; other eels remain in estuaries for their entire development prior to migration to the ocean. Movement into fresh water may not be obligatory but rather perhaps a density-dependent process (Haro and Krueger 1991, Feunteun et al. 2003), but further research is needed. Based on otolith microchemistry, Secor et al. (2002) found three modes of habitat use by yellow-phase eels in the Husdon River: freshwater, brackish water, and ""mixed"" modes. Freshwater mode eels were all captured in fresh water and showed no evidence of having previously resided in brackish water after metamorphosis into the elver stage. Yellow-phase eels captured in brackish water habitats showed two distinct modes of habitat use. Over half of the eels showed early freshwater habitat use (for 2-19 years), followed by a downstream migration into environments with brackish salinities (mixed mode). The third mode of habitat use showed no use of freshwater environments (brackish mode).<br><br>Soft, undisturbed bottom sediments may be important to migrating elvers for shelter (Facey and Van Den Avyle 1987). Postlarval eels tend to be bottom dwellers and hide in burrows, tubes, snags, plant masses, other types of shelter, or in the substrate; they are inactive in bottom mud in winter in the north (Van Den Avyle 1984). Mature adults migrate back downstream to return to the Sargasso Sea. In the ocean, American eels have been taken at depths greater than 6,000 meters. See Facey and Van Den Avyle (1987) for further information."
Dermochelys coriacea,"Habitat includes clear to turbid lakes, ponds, marshes, quiet pools, and backwaters of low gradient streams (creeks to large rivers) with soft bottoms and abundant aquatic plants, organic debris, and other cover (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Eggs apparently are brooded in the buccal cavity (Becker 1983)."
Glyptemys muhlenbergii,"This fish often occurs in large silty lakes and medium to large rivers, usually in open water over mud bottom, but it occurs in a wide variety of habitats (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). It spawns pelagically in open water, usually far from shore; eggs float at the surface (Becker 1983)."
Gopherus polyphemus,"This minnow is characteristic of headwater creeks and small to medium rivers with cool clear water, moderate or sometimes rapid current, and gravel or rubble bottoms; it commonly occurs in pools with current, riffles of small rocky streams; also in medium to large rivers, and sometimes in slow-moving, turbid water (Lee et al. 1980, Sublette et al. 1990, Page and Burr 2011). Individuals may congregate under stones or debris in winter. It is rare in lakes. Spawning occurs in nests made by males in riffles or gravel-bottomed pools, typically in shallow portions of streams near deep pools(Sublette et al. 1990). Eggs are covered with sand and fine gravel. This fish will use the nests of other cyprinids."
Graptemys barbouri,"Habitat includes rocky riffles and runs of creeks and small to medium rivers with cool clear water, moderate to swift current, and gravel bottoms; this fish often is in deep fast riffles (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). It has low tolerance of siltation."
Graptemys geographica,"Habitat includes rocky riffles, runs, and sometimes pools of headwaters, creeks, and small rivers (Page and Burr 2011). Generally this stoneroller is most abundant in clear moving water over gravel or rock substrate; riffles and raceways seem to be preferred. It is rarely taken from main channels of large rivers."
Graptemys pulchra,"Usually in still water with abundant vegetation: lakes, reservoirs, ponds, rivers, quiet streams. In clear or turbid water. Spawns in shallow water. Eggs are scattered and stick to objects."
Kinosternon baurii,"This fish is abundant in quiet, silt-bottomed pools and backwaters of rivers and larger creeks having low to moderate gradient (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). It frequently occurs in impoundments. In Oklahoma, it prefers relatively shallow water with little organic matter and large biomass of tubificids (see Sublette et al. 1990). Eggs are scattered over the bottom."
Kinosternon subrubrum,"This fish inhabits pools, backwaters, and main channels of clear to turbid waters of creeks, small to large rivers, and lakes (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). It spawns over sand and mud bottoms in quiet waters of streams or overflow areas in bends of rivers or bays of lakes (Scott and Crossman 1973)."
Lepidochelys kempii,"Habitat includes pools and backwaters of creeks and small to large rivers (Page and Burr 2011); rivers, oxbows, sloughs, and ponds over sand or gravel bottom; generally in rivers where current is moderate to swift or in quiet water adjacent to river channels. In some areas this carpsucker appears to prefer clearer waters (Cross and Collins 1995, Miller and Robison 2004). Large numbers may migrate to shallow areas and to overflow areas of streams to spawn; may spawn over riffles."
Macrochelys suwanniensis,"White suckers occur in a wide variety of lake and stream habitats. Some migrate dozens of kilometers between nonspawning habitats (lakes or streams) and spawning areas in stream or lake tributaries. Spawning occurs usually in swift water or rapids, often in small, clear, cool creeks and small to medium rivers in water less than 30 cm deep. Sometimes spawning occurs on lake shoals, beaches, or river mouths (areas with wave action). Eggs sink and usually stick to and become lodged in gravel."
Macrochelys temminckii,"This fish inhabits swamps, lakes, ponds, sloughs, low gradient creeks, and small rivers, usually over mud; it is most abundant in well-vegetated waters (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Eggs are laid in nests built by males on the bottom; nesting may be colonial."
Malaclemys terrapin,"This fish occurs near vegetation and debris in swamps, ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, pools, and backwaters (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011)."
Malaclemys terrapin centrata,"Habitat includes gravel-, sand-, and silt-bottomed pools of spring-fed headwaters (Page and Burr 2011); primarily cool and cold, clear, small creeks (first-order spring-fed streams) of the Ridge and Valley limestone region; species is most common a few hundred meters downstream of spring sources; streams range from less than 1 meter to 2 meters in width in faster flowing reaches (Starnes and Jenkins 1988, Etnier and Starnes 1993, Jenkins and Burkhead 1994). Typically streams are of relatively moderate gradient, well shaded by riparian growth or woodlands, and remain cool year-round (seldom above about 22 C) (Starnes and Jenkins 1988). This dace inhabits sluggish pool areas with substrates of fine gravel, sand, and silt, and it may congregate near cover of debris and undercut banks (Starnes and Jenkins 1988). <br><br>Tennessee dace require clean gravel in riffles and runs for spawning. An aggregation of males in spawning condition was observed in shallow water (8-10 centimeters deep) over clean, fine-gravel substrate at the head of a small riffle (Starnes and Jenkins 1988). Burkhead and Jenkins (1991) reported spawning in a pasture reach in Virginia. Small breeding aggregations occupied pits being dug by stoneroller minnows (<i>Campostoma anomalum</i>) and striped shiners (<i>Luxilus chrysocephalus</i>) at the tail of pools and in runs (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991)."
Pseudemys concinna,"Habitat includes small to medium streams with clear to turbid water and moderate current (Lee et al. 1980), and rocky flowing pools of headwaters, creeks, and small rivers; this fish is most common in small clear streams (Page and Burr 2011). It spawns on gravelly riffles and sometimes uses the nests of chubs. Eggs are scattered."
Pseudemys concinna suwanniensis,"This sculpin inhabits clear, cold to warm (typically cool) headwaters, creeks, springs, small rivers, and lakes, with sand and gravel or (more typically) rocky substrate; habitat preference varies geographically; often it occurs under rocks or vegetative cover (Scott and Crossman 1973, Peden and Hughes 1984, Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Male selects a spawning site under flat rock or ledge, in crevice among large gravel, among aquatic plants, or in tunnel (Becker 1983).<br><br>In Salt River watershed, Wyoming-Idaho, allopatric mottled sculpins (i.e., not sympatric with Paiute sculpins) occurred in spring streams that were wide and deep, dominated by fine substrate, and supported high densities of brown trout; mottled sculpins were absent from all tributaries on the eastern side of the drainage where streams had low summer water temperatures, high-gradient channels, and barriers that can influence upstream movements (Quist et al. 2004)."
Pseudemys floridana,"Habitat includes small to moderate-sized clear, cool to warm streams (Lee et al. 1980); gravel and rubble riffles of headwaters, creeks, and small rivers; also springs and their effluents; caves in some areas (Page and Burr 2011). This sculpin occurs probably only in spring-fed streams in Illinois (Smith 1979). Usually it is under rocks during daylight, on top of rocks at night in Tennessee (Greenberg and Holtzman 1987). Eggs are deposited possibly singly or are broadcast indiscriminately over gravel; no nests have been found."
Pseudemys nelsoni,"Habitat includes gravel and rubble riffles of headwaters, creeks, and small rivers, as well as springs and their effluents (Page and Burr 2011).<br><br>Usual habitat is rocky shoals and riffles of small upland streams, but occasionally the species is found in larger rivers (Neely et al. (2007). Typical habitat includes small streams with gravel or cobble substrate (Neely et al. 2007). This species appears to be highly sensitive to thermal regimes; populations in the southern part of the Chattahoochee River drainage are restricted to small streams draining forested watersheds and that lack small impoundments (including beaver ponds) (Neely et al. 2007). In headwater areas near the Blue Ridge physiographic province, this species can be relatively abundant (Neely et al. 2007)."
Sternotherus minor,"Usual habitat is rocky shoals and riffles of small upland streams, but occasionally the species is found in larger rivers (Neely et al. (2007). <br><br>Habitat is typically clean gravel or rocky-bottomed streams with moderate to swift current (Neely et al. 2007). Occupied streams range from 2-25 meters wide; individuals are most frequently encountered in streams 3-15 meters wide and at depths of 0.5-0.7 meters (Neely et al. 2007).  This species is absent from samples taken below small impoundments, from streams where riparian cover has been removed, and in stream segments affected by channelization (Neely et al. 2007). Generally it is not found in the mainstem Tallapoosa River, although several specimens are known from the mainstem just upstream of Martin Reservoir (Neely et al. 2007).<br><br>Tallapoosa sculpins are cavity-nesting speleophils (Neely et al. 2007)."

This shiner is common in raceways or near riffles; it frequents deep pools in association with large boulders and rocky banks (Mayden 1989). Eggs are laid in crevices between rocks or logs, under bark, or on undersides of rocks and other surfaces (Mayden 1989)."
Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi,"This shiner usually occurs in small to medium rivers, 6-12 meters wide, with sand, silt, or gravel bottoms; most often in swift current in raceways and deep riffles, also in slow to moderate current in pools and eddies (Howell and Williams 1971, Page and Burr 2011)."
Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus,"Habitat is confined almost entirely to channels and runs of medium to large, sand-bottomed Coastal Plain rivers, although juveniles often are near shore (Gilbert, in Mayden 1989; Page and Burr 2011). Eggs are laid in crevices as in other <i>Cyprinella</i>."
Agonostomus monticola,"Habitat includes perennial creeks and small to medium rivers, canals, lakes, ponds, and ephemeral habitats with high turbidity and few competing species; silty, sandy, and rocky pools and runs, sometimes riffles (Sublette et al. 1990, Page and Burr 2011). This species often is the most abundant minnow in a wide variety of low gradient habitats, especially backwaters, creek mouths, and medium-sized streams with sand/silt bottoms. It is uncommon or absent in clear high-gradient streams. It selects water with negligible (or intermittent) flow deeper than 20 cm, and it avoids temperature extremes in summer and winter, but does well in harsh and variable environments when other species disappear (Mayden 1989). Spawning occurs in quiet waters of lakes or streams, often over sunfish nests, clean gravel or sand of riffles, submerged roots or logs, or aquatic plants, or on rocky shorelines in crevices. Eggs sink and adhere to bottom (gravel, sand, or mud). Male defends spawning territory."
Allohistium cinereum,"This shiner is most abundant in large Piedmont  and montane streams (small to medium rivers, less often in creeks); it is usually in and around riffles or swift runs in the main channel, usually in the lower part of water column over sand and gravel substrate (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Eggs probably are laid in crevices."
Alosa aestivalis,"Habitat includes moderate to large streams and rivers of low to high turbidity, with bottom of sand, gravel, mud or rubble (Lee et al. 1980). Sometimes this species occurs in lakes and sloughs (Becker 1983). Most frequently it occurs in large creeks and small rivers with clear permanent flow; not typically in larger turbid rivers or intermittent creeks; usually it is in or near riffles or raceways over gravel in moderate to fast current (Mayden 1989). Spawning occurs in rock crevices, on logs having loose bark or crevices, or on underside of submerged logs or roots (Becker 1983, Scott and Crossman 1973), near riffles in swift current (Mayden 1989)."
Alosa alabamae,"Habitat includes rocky and sandy runs and pools of creeks and small to medium rivers (Page and Burr 2011); cool, clear, continuous flowing, small to medium-sized streams, where the species is associated with deep riffles and raceways (less common in pools) (Mayden 1989). "
Alosa chrysochloris,"This fish is most common in pools and runs of clear, sandy-bottomed, small to medium rivers, typically in areas with sparse vegetation and strong current, but upland populations occur in creeks over substrates with more gravel and rubble (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Populations in the western part of the range are often in turbid water. Eggs are deposited in crevices."
Alosa mediocris,"Habitat includes rocky and sandy pools of creeks and small rivers (Page and Burr 2011). This shiner is most often taken in small to moderate-sized, clear, cool streams; it seems to prefer pools behind obstacles along and under banks (Lee et al. 1980). "
Alosa pseudoharengus,"This fish is usually near vegetation in relatively shallow brackish or fresh water of  bays, inlets, salt marshes, lakes, or tidal rivers. It may be abundant where the bottom is at least partially sandy, emergent vegetation is lacking, and there is little current or wave action. It tolerates high temperature and salinity. Rarely does it occur far inland except in peninsular Florida. Eggs sink and stick together in clumps by numerous threads (Thomson et al. 1978)."
Alosa sapidissima,"Usually occurs in rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, swamps, or low-salinity estuaries; usually in shallow water with abundant vegetation and little or no current; generally does not inhabit first-order, cold streams or deep lakes with little or no littoral zone. Tolerant of wide range in oxygen, salinity, turbidity, and bottom conditions. Fry, juveniles, and adults tolerate temperatures between 5 and 35 C; optimal growth occurs between 25 and 30 C (Edwards and Twomey 1982). Carp can live in water with turbidities in excess of 200 JUnrankable  and secchi disc visibilities less than 8 cm (3.2 in) (Jester 1974). A pH level greater than 10.5 or less than 5.0 is harmful (Edwards and Twomey 1982). Air gulping occurs when dissolved oxygen (DO) level is less than 0.5 mg/l; 6-7 mg/l DO is needed for optimum growth (Edwards and Twomey 1982). Some carp occur in areas with water currents as swift as 120 cm/sec, but much slower waters are preferred, such as less than 20 cm/sec in the Missouri River (Edwards and Twomey 1982). <br><br>Optimal river habitat is characterized by warm water (above 20 degrees C during the growing season, about mid-June through August), low gradient (above 1.5 m/km), shallow vegetated marshland available for spawning, at least 50% of the river area in pools or off-channel areas, adequate cover (logs, brush, etc.) in pools, and fertile conditions. <br><br>Optimal lake habitat has warm water (as defined above), at least 25% littoral area, aquatic or inundated vegetation for spawning, deeper waters for overwintering, and fertile conditions (Edwards and Twomey 1982). In winter, carp may occur in deeper water than used in summer. In Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, adults spent the summer in 3-4 ft (0.9-1.2 m) of water and moved to 4-8 ft (1.2-2.4 m) in the winter (Otis and Weber 1982). Carp spent the winter in 5-7 m of water in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (Johnson and Hasler 1977). <br><br>Usually, carp spawn in shallows and flooded areas in water depths of less than 0.5 m, but spawning has been observed in 1.8 m deep water (Edwards and Twomey 1982). Eggs are scattered and stick to submerged objects. Carp fry stay attached to the vegetation for about two days before dropping to the bottom, and they inhabit shallow (less than 2 m), warm sluggish water during their first summer (Edwards and Twomey 1982)."
Ambloplites ariommus,"Shallow coastal waters. Moves to near-shore waters in winter. Only North American stingray commonly entering fresh water, which it does most commonly in Florida (e.g., St. Johns River); has been recorded in the Mississipi River 200 miles upstream (Robins and Ray 1986). Generally prefers soft bottom habitats. (Lee et al. 1980).

Cyprinella lutrensis,"Habitat includes clear sandy and rocky pools of creeks and small to medium rivers with moderate gradient and fast water, occasionally sluggish murky streams (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Pools usually have bottoms of sand or sand and gravel. Eggs are laid in gravel in riffles."
Cyprinella nivea,"This species occurs principally in shallow rocky riffles in clear headwaters, creeks, and small to medium rivers; often it is associated with vegetation, brush, or rocks that give protection; it also occurs over clean sand and gravel in slower currents (Kuehne and Barbour 1983, Page and Burr 2011)."
Cyprinella spiloptera,"Habitat comprises bedrock pools and rocky riffles of creeks and small rivers (Page and Burr 2011); including the main channel of the upper Tallapoosa and Little Tallapoosa rivers; recent collections have been made where the substrate consists of boulders and rubble, with some gravel and stretches of sand (Suttkus and Etnier 1991). Members of this subgenus typically lay eggs on the sides of large rocks (Suttkus and Etnier 1991)."
Cyprinella trichroistia,"Habitat includes stream edges, quiet backwaters, or pools of small to large creeks and small to moderate-size rivers with moderate current over sand and gravel, or over small cobble, pebble, and gravel substrates often covered with a thin layer of silt, where the darters usually occur in association with detritus, logs, or sticks, often where there are beds of water-willow (Kuehne and Barbour 1983, Page 1983, Ryon 1986, Etnier and Starnes 1993, Mettee et al. 1996, Boschung and Mayden 2004, Page and Burr 2011). Spawning occurs in shallow spring-fed seepage areas feeding headwater streams, including flooded wooded seepage areas, floodplain forests, and often-flooded pastures with shallow drainage ditches; adhesive eggs stick to plants and other objects (Page 1983, Ryon 1986, Etnier and Starnes 1993). The darters depend on a certain degree of flooding in order to access spawning habitat."
Cyprinella venusta,"Habitat includes rocky riffles of creeks and small to medium rivers (Page and Burr 2011); streams of moderate gradient with bottoms of coarse gravel to rubble, often at depths over 25 cm at or near midchannel. In Arkansas, spawning occurred in runs about 0.6-1.6 meters deep with moderate current velocities (Walters 1994). Trautman (1981) reported spawning at depths of less than 0.6 meters. Eggs are laid on algae and moss growing on stones and boulders in riffles or runs (Becker 1983, Walters 1994)."
Cyprinella xaenura,"This fish occurs over sand and gravel in margins, pools, and backwaters of creeks and small to medium rivers; it seems to be most abundant in shallow sandy backwaters of clean, free-flowing, medium-sized creeks (Cashner et al. 1988, Mettee et al. 1996, Boschung and Mayden 2004, Page and Burr 2011)."

Dasyatis sabina,"Typically this species is found in  backwater areas of sluggish lowland creeks and small to medium rivers, swamps, and marshes, often in association with extensive aquatic vegetation (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). The frequently ephemeral nature of the habitat suggests that eggs may often survive and develop in dewatered substrate, as is true of various other cyprinodontid species."
Dormitator maculatus,"Habitat includes fresh and brackish waters (maximum salinity 20.4 ppt); this species has been collected in bayous, open pools in mangrove swamps, tidal streams, and freshwater rivers and streams, mainly in grassy backwaters and brackish bays, not along open beaches (Robins and Ray 1986, Page and Burr 2011). Adhesive eggs typically are deposited where some desiccation will occur, thereby delaying hatching (Lee et al. 1980)."
Dorosoma cepedianum,"Habitat includes quiet waters of lakes, ponds, and sluggish streams, usually over sand, gravel, or detritus-covered bottom where there are patches of submerged aquatic plants; schools tend to stay in shallows in summer; this species also often occurs in estuaries (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Eggs are released in clusters, attach by filaments to plants in quiet weedy pools (Scott and Crossman 1973)."
Dorosoma petenense,"Habitat includes vegetated sloughs, swamps, and quiet pools and backwaters of streams (Page and Burr 2011)."
Elassoma evergladei,"Mummichogs are common in salt marsh flats, estuaries, and tidal creeks, especially where there is abundant submergent and emergent vegetation. Adults use intertidal zone only when it is flooded; young remain on marsh even at low tide, inhabiting shallow puddles (Kneib 1986). They occasionally enter freshwater streams and rivers (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). Individuals may burrow into bottom mud in winter. Spawning occurs in fresh, brackish, or saltwater; generally in estuarine and salt marsh environments. Eggs are laid in various sites at levels reached only by high spring tides; usually in sand in New England populations and in <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> or empty <i>Geukensia demissa</i> shells in Middle Atlantic and southern populations (Taylor 1986). Eggs normally incubate in air (aerial incubation apparently is essential for survival), not submerged until next spring tide. Abrupt decreases in salinity (e.g. due to spring freshets) may decrease fertilization success and increase larval mortality in local populations (Able and Palmer 1988)."
Elassoma gilberti,"Habitat includes pools and backwaters of clear streams; swamps, ponds, and other vegetated standing waters (Page and Burr 2011). Where sympatric with <i>F. escambiae</i>, <i>F. lineolatus</i> tends to inhabit upper reaches of drainage whereas <i>escambiae </i>inhabits lower reaches."
Elassoma okatie,"Habitat includes high intertidal areas in brackish, sometimes oxygen-deficient shallow ditches, mudholes, and tidal rivulets in stands of smooth cordgrass (Byrne 1978); also upper tidal marsh areas where water is almost completely fresh (Jenkins and Burkhead 1994). This species has been recorded from freshwater ponds in Virginia and Maryland (Lee et al. 1980)."
Elassoma okefenokee,"This species occurs near the surface in quiet or flowing, relatively clear, sand-gravel bottom headwaters, creeks, and small rivers; often occurs along margins near thick stands of emergent vegetation (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011)."

Eleotris amblyopsis,"Typically this species occurs in backwater areas of sluggish lowland creeks and small to medium rivers, swamps, and marshes, often in association with extensive aquatic vegetation (Page and Burr 2011). The frequently ephemeral nature of habitat suggests that eggs may often survive and develop in substrate lacking standing water, as is true of various other cyprinodontid species."
Enneacanthus chaetodon,"Margins, pools, and backwaters of creeks and small to medium rivers; most common in shallow sandy backwaters of clean rocky creeks (Page and Burr 2011)."
Enneacanthus gloriosus,"Habitat includes river channels, margins, backwaters; springs, marshes, and artificial habitats of all kinds (Minckley et al. 1991). Often this species occurs in shallow, often stagnant, ponds and the shallow edges of lakes and streams where predatory fishes are largely absent and temperatures are high. It is most abundant in shallow water with thick vegetation (Hubbs 1971). It also occurs in brackish sloughs and coastal saltwater habitats (Tabb and Manning 1961, Odum 1971). This fish is more tolerant of pollution than are most other fishes (Lewis 1970, Kushlan 1974). It tolerates dissolved oxygen levels as low as 0.18 mg/L (Ahuja 1964) but cannot tolerate extreme cold; temperature apparently limits the range northward (Hubbs 1971). However, some populations are known to overwinter under ice in Indiana and Illinois (Krumholz 1944)."
Enneacanthus obesus,"This species often occurs in shallow, often stagnant, ponds and shallow edges of lakes and streams where predatory fishes are largely absent and temperatures are high. It also can be found in brackish sloughs and coastal saltwater habitats."
Erimonax monachus,"Flame chubs inhabit springs, shallow seepage waters, and spring-fed streams (1 meter to more than 20 meters wide), usually over gravel in areas where aquatic vegetation is abundant (Etnier and Starnes 1993,Page and Burr 2011) or in slackwater near the bank in large streams (Boschung and Mayden 2004). Substrate may vary from mud to rubble or bedrock (Boschung and Mayden 2004). Sossamon (1990) found that a flame chub population in east Tennessee was usually associated with aquatic vegetation such as watercress, swamp smartweed, and small pondweed. Additionally, apparently spawning aggregations have been observed in flooded pastures and fields (Etnier and Starnes 1993, Mettee et al. 1996). <br><br>Although the species has been often described as a spring-dweller, only 16% of the 231 collection localities obtained by P. W. Shute were actually described as springs. However, examination of topographic maps indicates that most collection localities are within watersheds where springs are numerous. Most records are from streams of 4th order or smaller. It is possible that the species is relatively vagile and migrates to headwater areas, such as springs, or seeps adjacent to streams, for spawning. Alternatively, the species may exist in metapopulations, with the springs or seeps serving as refugia and sources for the stream localities."
Erimystax insignis,"Habitat includes heavily vegetated, standing and slow-flowing waters; weedy pond and stream margins, marshes; from fresh to brackish (about 30 ppt) water (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011)."

Adults also occur in large reservoirs. Eggs are laid in a nest in the river bottom; may cover eggs with stones (Becker 1983)."
Etheostoma coosae,Habitat includes gravel and sand riffles and runs of small rivers and creeks; larvae burrow into detritus in slack water areas (Lee et al. 1980) or in flowing water near sand bars and debris (Page and Burr 2011). Eggs are laid in clean riffle areas.
Etheostoma ditrema,"Habitat includes clean, clear, gentle- or high-gradient creeks (1-23 meters wide, 30-60 centimeters deep) with substrates generally of sand, pebbles, and small stones (Schwartz 1959, Burr and Warren 1986, Boschung and Mayden 2004,Page and Burr 2011). Adults occur in riffles or runs, under overhanging banks, or occasionally they attach to stones in the current; larvae burrow into beds of mixed sand, mud, and organic debris in pools and backwaters (Burr and Warren 1986, Page and Burr 2011). In Pennsylvania, spawning occurred just above swift riffles and throughout slow to moderate riffles (Raney 1939). In West Virginia, spawning occurred in the middle and lower portions of riffles (Schwartz 1959). In Virginia, Jenkins and Burkhead (1994) observed a spawning group in a gentle, shallow run of mostly small, loose gravel in a stream 2-4 meters wide."

Etheostoma fricksium,"Habitat includes pools, oxbow lakes, and deeper waters of large rivers; sometimes backwaters and mouths of smaller rivers; reservoirs and lakes. This species prefers clean to moderately turbid, deep, warm waters (Sublette et al. 1990). In Texas, habitats with abundant aquatic vegetation and silt bottoms were most productive (see Sublette et al. 1990). Spawning occurs n quiet pools, backwaters, flooded marshes, and meadows. Eggs sink and adhere to objects."
Etheostoma fusiforme,Habitat includes pools and backwaters small to large rivers; reservoirs; lakes (Page and Burr 2011). This species is often in strong currents of large rivers (Lee et al. 1980). Spawning occurs in flooded areas.
Etheostoma gutselli,"Habitat varies geographically. In some areas, this species is abundant near the surface of clear warm waters of rivers, creeks, lakes, and reservoirs. In other areas, it occurs only in slow areas and backwaters of rivers. In streams, it occupies cool and warm waters, low and moderate gradients, and areas with various substrates and differing amounts of vegetation (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). Apparently it favors clear water in most areas. In lakes, young stay offshore initially, later in summer they begin to move into shallows at night. Generally individuals remain inshore over water up to 2 meters deep in winter. Spawning occurs over aquatic vegetation or gravel beds. Eggs adhere to objects contacting sticky filament attached to egg."

May move into gravelly streams with clearer water if river becomes excessively silted. May move into shallows during day. Winters in deep holes in Mississippi River. In some lakes, usually in water less than 10 m deep. In lakes, probably spawns in open waters."
Gambusia affinis,"Coastal and freshwater habitats. Moderate to highly alkaline and euryhaline waters. Moves far up streams and rivers, especially in southern part of range. In fresh water, usually swims at surface of clear quiet water over sand and gravel bottom. Introduced in ponds, lakes, and reservoirs outside native range. See Weinstein (1986) for habitat suitability index model. Spawns over beds of aquatic vegetation or among emergent vegetation (Moyle 1976). Survival and growth of larvae was greater at salinity of 15 ppt than at 5 or 30 ppt (see Sublette et al. 1990). Some landlocked populations (e.g., where introduced in reservoirs) reproduce in fresh water (Page and Burr 1991)."
Gambusia holbrooki,"Anadromous; breeds in freshwater, young live in the open ocean for an indeterminate period of time and return to fresh water to reproduce (Voss et al. 1969, Gilmore and Hastings 1982, Gilbert and Relyea 1992). In the open ocean, individuals occur in patches of floating <i>Sargassum</i> algae and are often attracted to lights at night (Robins et al. 1986). Eggs are held in a brood pouch by the male. In Florida, breeding occurs in freshwater tributaries with dense emergent vegetation dominated by <i>Panicum</i> spp. and <i>Polygonum</i> spp. (Gilbert 1978, Gilbert and Relyea 1992, Gilmore and Gilbert 1992, Gilbert 1992). In Mississippi, individuals have been recorded from <i>Spartina</i> spp. marshes (Dawson 1970). <br><br>In Florida, from 1972-81, 235 specimens (64-175 mm long) were captured from all months of the year from freshwater tributaries to the southern Indian River lagoon (Gilmore 1977, Gilmore and Hastings 1983). Most of the individuals (98%) were collected in fresh water, with a salinity less than 1.0 parts per thousand (Gilmore and Hastings 1983). The greatest number of individuals taken in a single collection was 25 (November 1979). Most specimens (145 individuals or 64%) were collected during the winter months (November-March). Few specimens were collected during the wet season (June-October), with a seasonal population low during peak rainfall months (August-October) (Gilmore and Hastings 1983). There appeared to be a late winter migration of young adults into fresh water for summer spawning (Gilmore 1977). The smallest specimens (five individuals, 64-86 mm in length) were taken at higher salinity (maximum 37 parts per thousand) in seagrass beds of the Indian River lagoon and coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean (Gilmore and Hastings 1983)."
Hemitremia flammea,"Habitat includes rocky riffles and pools of creeks and small to medium rivers (Page and Burr 2011); shoal areas of rivers and large creeks in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain. This species requires stretches of river characterized by rocky substrate (Williams 1998). Dams and impoundments are definite barriers to dispersal (J. D. Williams, pers. comm., 1998). Any significant amount of urban development surrounding rivers in which the species occurs poses hazards, especially in terms of reducing water volume and causing thermal and chemical pollution. Eggs are laid in a saucer-shaped nest made in the bottom substrate by the male."
Heterandria formosa,There is little information on habitat use by this species other than it is riverine and based on occurrences occupies medium to large rivers.

Lake populations may move a short distance up a stream to spawn. Females deposit eggs in nests made by males, usually near cover on gravel or sand bottoms. Individual males may nest close to the previous year's nest site(Ridgway et al. 1991)."

Hybopsis winchelli,"Largemouth basses inhabit warm, quiet waters with low turbidity, soft bottoms, and beds of aquatic plants. Typical habitats include farm ponds, swamps, lakes, reservoirs, sloughs, creek pools, and river coves and backwaters. Many of the largest populations are in mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes or reservoirs. In lakes and reservoirs these fishes are usually close to shore. In general, they are in deeper water in winter than in summer. <br><br>Eggs are laid in shallow cleared depressions (nests) made by males in sand, gravel, or debris-littered bottoms, often at depths of 40-80 inches (1-2 meters) but up to at least 23 feet (7 meters) or as shallow as 8-12 inches (about 20-30 cm).

Ichthyomyzon gagei,"Habitat includes open waters of large lakes and reservoirs and pools of slow-moving small to large rivers. This species usually occurs in surface waters, roaming in schools. It tends to be offshore during the day, inshore at night. It generally avoids areas of continuous turbidity. Running water of tributary streams appear to be preferred for spawning, but this fish may spawn along lake shores with high wave action. Spawning substrate is usually rock or gravel bottoms in water 0.6-3 meters deep; eggs sink and stick; individuals generally return to specific spawning areas. Information primarily from Becker (1983) and Moyle (1976)."
Ichthyomyzon greeleyi,"This is a marine and estuarine coastal species that moves far upstream in channels of medium to large rivers during spawning migrations. In coastal areas, it occurs typically within 6 km of shore. Adults in inshore areas occur over a wide range of substrates. The species has been widely introduced in lakes and impoundments. Some populations complete the life cycle in freshwater. In colder months, striped bass tend to seek the warmest water available at depths greater than 1.5 meters.<br><br>Striped bass use rivers, tidally influenced fresh waters, and estuaries for spawning and nursery areas. Preferred spawning areas often are shallow (1-20 feet, 0.3-6.1 meters) and turbid and range from the tidal zone to a few hundred kilometers upstream (usually within 38 miles or 60 km of coast). Spawners often seek areas with strong turbulent flow and substrates of rock and/or fine gravel. At Powell Reservoir, Utah, spawning occurred over a rocky shoal in or near the mixing zone of river water and reservoir water. <br><br>Eggs are semibuoyant, drift and sink slowly; in riverine populations, current of about 30 cm/sec reportedly is required to keep eggs afloat and prevent death due to settling on bottom (though this may vary with differences in egg buoyancy in different regions). Juveniles apparently prefer clean sandy bottom but have been found over gravel, rock, and (rarely) soft mud; may or may not move to areas of higher salinity in first summer/fall (varies with locality).<br><br>See Hill et al.

Adults generally occupy moderate to swift water over clean gravel, boulders, and rubble, or in deep, fast-flowing portions of pools. Small individuals often are in pool shallows and backwaters (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). Spawns in excavated nest in gravel and gravel-rubble in shoals or large runs (Becker 1983, Lee et al. 1980).

Moxostoma lacerum,"In Tennessee, this species is restricted to the main channel of the Conasauga River, where it occurs in flowing pools and deeper runs with clean substrates of sand and fine gravel with scattered boulders (Etnier and Starnes 1993). It has been found associated with vegetation in riffle areas in midsummer. Usually it is in cool, clear water up to 60 cm deep (usually 29-49 cm), with moderate to swift current (averaging around 7-27 cm/sec at substrate); it occurs in only a small percentage of shoals with these characteristics (Lee et al. 1980; 1990 End. Sp. Tech. Bull. 15[2]:5). The species is limited upstream from occupied sites probably by excessive stream gradient, downstream by heavy siltation (Matthews and Moseley 1990) and reservoir.

Moxostoma lachneri,"Habitat includes clear montane creeks and small rivers of moderate to steep gradient. Thompson (in Lee et al. 1980) reported that adults are most often taken from deep, swiftly flowing runs and rapids near boulders, whereas juveniles and young occur in shallower, quieter waters, sometimes pools. In Virginia, juveniles and adults usually are in pools and slow runs of gravel, rubble, boulder, and bedrock, and occasionally occupy swifter, shallower sections; they often move near the bottom in open water and may perch on large boulders and logs in pools (Jenkins and Burkhead 1994). In Tennessee, this species inhabits deeper riffles and runs with boulders, large rubble, and bedrock substrates, in clearer portions of headwater tributaries, moving to deeper pools for winter; juveniles often occur in pools with silty sand substrates (Etnier and Starnes 1993). In Tennessee, Howell (1971) reported that large males often occupy riffles in summer and fall. In the Little River, Tennessee, Greenberg (1991) found this species in relatively deep water in riffles, runs, and most frequently pools, often over silty substrates but typically feeding on rocks substrate. In Virginia, spawning darters were in shallows of moderate to swift current, with substrates of sand or intermixed sand and gravel (Jenkins and Burkhead 1994).

In Virginia, blotchside logperches occurred mainly in slow runs and pools, adults and larger juveniles occupied riffles and runs and occasionally pools (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). This species usually avoids turbid water and silty substrates (Boschung and Mayden 2004), and it apparently is intolerant of reservoir conditions (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991).

This darter usually occurs in flowing pools and backwaters adjacent to runs; it may hover over or rest on submerged objects such woody debris, plant stems, or large cobble (Williams et al. 2007). In the Conasauga River, this darter tends to occur in sandy runs with moderate water velocity and relatively shallow water depth (Johnson et al. 2002). It has been found among leaf packs in pools in winter (Williams et al. 2007)."
Nothonotus chuckwachatte,"Habitat includes fast, deep rocky riffles of small to medium rivers (Page and Burr 2011). Adults are most common in moderate-fast current, in deeper water (> 0.8 m) in heavy cover such as log jams, undercut banks, boulders, or potholes. Juveniles occur in shallower water with slower current, such as in vegetation in gently flowing riffles. Dams, impoundments, and inappropriate stream conditions hinder the movements of this darter (Pierson, pers. comm., 1998)."
Nothonotus etowahae,"Headwaters to medium-sized rivers, over sandy, gravelly, or rocky bottom, also over mud and silt in lower Coastal Plain; often associated with aquatic vegetation."
Nothonotus jordani,"Small to medium rivers; in swift riffles over large gravel or rubble. Largest individuals in very swift water, smaller individuals in smaller slower riffles over gravel or sometimes in gravel raceways."
Nothonotus rufilineatus,"Fast runs and sometimes riffles of creeks and small to medium rivers of moderate to low gradient (if not highly turbid). Mostly over coarse clean gravel at depths of 20 cm or more in spring and early summer. Occurs also in or near aquatic vegetation if present, and in pools. Spawns probably over loose gravel at depth of 30-90 cm."
Nothonotus vulneratus,"Large rivers and lower part of tributaries; deep chutes and riffles where current is swift and bottom is coarse gravel or rock. Smaller individuals generally occur in slower water than do larger ones. Adults generally at depth of 1 m or more. May typically spawn at depths of 1/2 m or a little more in areas of strong current, scattered rubble, and associated clean gravel (Kuehne and Barbour 1983)."
Notropis amplamala,"Habitat includes rocky riffles and flowing pools and runs of creeks and small rivers (Page and Burr 2011). Habitat in the Tallapoosa River proper (width 75-125 meters, depth 0.5-1 meters) and in tributaries (width 4-5 meters, depth 0.2-1 meters and larger) includes clear water flowing over sand, gravel, rubble, and bedrock, in pools below riffles as well as riffles with moderate current, and occasionally margins of large rocks in areas of fast flowing water (Wieland and Ramsey 1987, Boschung and Mayden 2004, Williams et al. 2007). Larger individuals were found in areas of swift current, whereas smaller ones were in habitats with more moderate flow (Williams et al. 2007)."
Notropis ariommus,"Habitat includes small to medium upland rivers, including high-gradient streams in chutes with moderate to torrential current over rubble and boulders, deeper downstream portions of gravel riffles in streams of moderate gradient, and sometimes shallow pools with gravel or rock bottoms (Comiskey and Etnier 1972; Burr and Warren 1986; Etnier and Starnes 1993; C. F. Saylor, personal communication). These very narrow habitat requirements may contribute to low vagility. Presently, little is known about how far individuals are capable of traveling through unsuitable habitat (e.g., extensive low gradient runs, pools, or impoundments) to reach preferred sites, but it is plausible that an area with poor habitat for a considerable distance would hinder dispersal. Distributional records for streams in the upper end of Fontana Reservoir provide some indication, however, that these areas (relatively short distances through impoundments) may be used as dispersal routes (especially when reservoir is at low pool levels). However, there are no data to indicate that the species is a resident component of the reservoir fish community."
Notropis asperifrons,"Habitat includes gravel and sand runs of medium-sized rivers (Page and Burr 2011). Adults and spawning individuals inhabit sand and gravel shoals of moderately flowing, vegetated, large creeks and river; also in deeper portions of rivers and reservoirs where current is present (Etnier and Starnes 1993, Boschung and Mayden 2004). Young occur in slackwater habitats, including the deeper portions of rivers and reservoirs (Boschung and Mayden 2004). Individuals often burrow into substrate (Etnier and Starnes 1993, Boschung and Mayden 2004)."
Notropis atherinoides,N/A
Notropis baileyi,"Adults migrate from the ocean or lake to spawning streams. Landlocked populations in lakes may migrate up to about 50 miles upstream for spawning. Anadromous populations with access to the ocean migrate up to a couple hundred miles. Females deposit numerous small eggs in nests made by males in gravel, sand, and rubble of streams with moderately strong current. Larvae burrow in sand and silt bottom in quiet water downstream from spawning areas and filter-feed on plankton and detritus."
Notropis chalybaeus,Gravel and rubble-bottomed runs and riffles of creeks and small to medium rivers.
Notropis chrosomus,"Habitat includes cool to warm, usually clear, rocky streams (creeks and small to medium rivers), of moderate to high gradient; in runs and riffles over clean gravel, rubble, and boulder substrates (Lee et al. 1980, Burkhead and Jenkins 1991, Page and Burr 2011). Spawning occurs in same habitat as that occupied during other seasons (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991)."
Notropis hudsonius,"Habitat includes rocky and, more frequently, gravelly runs and riffles in warm, generally clear, moderate- to high-gradient creeks and small to medium rivers (Lee et al. 1980, Burr and Warren 1986, Page and Burr 1991, Etnier and Starnes 1993, Jenkins and Burkhead 1994). Adults and juveniles generally occur over clean or very slightly silted gravel and small to medium rubble; small young have been found in calm shallows at a sand-gravel bar (Jenkins and Burkhead 1993). In Kentucky, young are often near beds of water-willow or in the margins of flowing pools (Burr and Warren 1986)."
Notropis hypsilepis,"Lakes, ponds, rivers, and creeks in a variety of habitats. Most common in clear rocky streams. Schools in midwater or near bottom. Spawns in nest made by male under object on bottom on sandy or gravelly shoals, eggs attached to underside of cover."
Notropis leuciodus,"Lakes, ponds, headwaters, creeks, small rivers, ditches, reservoirs, residual pools of intermittent streams (where sometimes very abundant); usually in sluggish or still water with abundant floating and submerged vegetation; tolerant of high temperature, turbidity, low oxygen, and high salinity. Adapts well to pond culture. Eggs are laid on underside of object in quiet water in nest guarded by male. Larvae collected in shoreline drift in upper Colorado River (where introduced)."
Notropis longirostris,"Pools, backwaters, and quiet runs of small to large rivers having continuous flow and low to moderate gradient, over sand, silt, or gravel; most common in medium-sized rivers; also in some reservoirs; tolerant of turbidity; avoids rapid currents; in Guadalupe drainage, Texas, greatest numbers were at upstream end of silty pools (Sublette et al. 1990). Spawns under flat stones or debris in shallow pools or slowly flowing water, in nest constructed and guarded by male (Becker 1983)."
Notropis lutipinnis,"Fresh, brackish, and salt waters along coast; springs, lakes and ponds, backwaters and pools of streams, drainage ditches, and salt marshes in Florida. Irrigation canals in southern California. Around springs in quieter water with little temperature fluctuation in Texas. Warm-adapted; can tolerate salinities up to 87 ppt (Sublette et al. 1990) and can tolerate waterways degraded by sewage and industrial effluents (Felley and Daniels 1992)."
Notropis maculatus,"Most abundant in sand- and mud-bottomed pools and backwaters of warm turbid creeks, small to large rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. During day, tends to congregate around submerged logs or boulders in quiet water 2-4 m deep, or in dimly lit profundal zone of reservoir. May move into open water in evening and early morning. Shallow littoral zone is occupied by young and by foraging adults. Eggs are laid in an ill-defined nest made by the male on the bottom in water usually less than 1.5 m deep. Nest often is near or in beds of vegetation or plant debris (including flooded terrestrial vegetation), sometimes under or near overhanging bushes or banks."
Notropis petersoni,"Most abundant in large, warm, clear lakes and reservoirs and clear river backwaters; usually associated with large beds of aquatic plants and sandy to mucky bottoms. Usually in localized schools near submerged objects during day. Eggs are laid in a nest made by the male in bottoms ranging from mud to gravel, usually in water less than 1 m deep near or in beds of aquatic plants."
Notropis photogenis,"Pools and runs over sand and mud, usually in clear or tannin-stained creeks and small rivers (Page and Burr 1991). In South Carolina, adults were associated with noticeable current, usually in scour pools or eddies (Fletcher 1993). In South Carolina, used slow, still pools for spawning and larval rearing; spawned in nests of redbreast sunfish (Fletcher 1993)."
Notropis scepticus,"Habitat includes clay, sand, and bedrock pools of clear headwaters, creeks, and small rivers in which water is often brownish; this shiner is usually taken near logs, debris, or aquatic vegetation over various substrates (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011)."
Notropis spectrunculus,"Habitat includes headwaters, creeks, and small rivers, in slow, often tannin-stained water, usually in sand- or silt-bottomed pools, in or near aquatic vegetation, or along undercut banks or debris (Boschung and Mayden 2004, Page and Burr 2011)."
Notropis stilbius,Closely associated with springs and spring runs where water temperatures usually range from 20-23 C. Also occurs underground and occurs in isolated caves and sinkholes not connected by surface waters.
Notropis telescopus,"Habitat includes sand- and silt-bottomed pools and runs of headwaters, creeks, and small rivers, usually near vegetation (Page and Burr 2011)."
Notropis texanus,"Habitat includes small to intermediate (and sometimes large) streams with moderate to swift flow and sandy substrates; in headwater streams, this fish is found in pools in sections with alternating runs and pools; in larger streams it often occupies eddies behind debris or plants; during floods, it may occur in ephemeral braids on the floodplain; schools of 10 to 75+ individuals face upstream in the middle of the water column (Marcy et al. 2005). This fish scatters its demersal, adhesive eggs over the bottom, probably in runs with aquatic macrophytes (Marcy et al. 2005)."
Notropis volucellus,"Habitat includes deep, slow-moving, coastal creeks and small to medium rivers of varying clarity and usually with silty bottoms, often heavily choked with brush and vegetation (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). These shiners seem to prefer deep pools and backwaters (often 1-2 meters) to more shallow areas."
Notropis xaenocephalus,"Most abundant in large and medium-sized, low- to moderate-gradient rivers and reservoirs. Highest growth rates generally occur in turbid, relatively shallow areas and in lower portions of streams (Lee and Terrell 1987). Adults occur in deep holes created by swirling currents, often among or near piles of drift, tangled timber, or other cover. Young often found in rocky and sandy runs and riffles (Becker 1983). See Lee and Terrell (1987) for a habitat suitability index model. <br><br>Spawns in secluded shelters and dark places such as hollow logs, riverbank holes, rock crevices, and among submerged timber, at depths of 2-5 m."
Noturus eleutherus,"Characteristic of clean, swiftly flowing, gravel or bouldery creeks and small to medium rivers; also in inshore waters of lakes over gravel or boulder bottoms. May move offshore to deeper water in summer in warm lakes. Rests under stones when inactive. Spawns probably in riffles over a gravelly bottom, sometimes over or near river chub nests. Also spawns in shallow, pebble-bottomed, wave-swept shorelines of lakes. Fry occupy quiet shallow protected margins of streams, move into swift water within 6 weeks."
Noturus flavipinnis,"Habitat includes rocky runs and pools of headwaters, creeks, and small rivers (Page and Burr 2011)."
Noturus funebris,"Mostly in cold, medium to high gradient streams, but lake and sea-run populations also exist. Tends to occupy deeper, lower velocity, and warmer waters than other species of trout (Sublette et al. 1990). Does best where dissolved oxygen concentration is at least 9 ppm and, in small streams, where canopy shade is 50-75% at midday (Sublette et al. 1990). Some migratory populations spend first 2 years in river, 1-2 years in lake, then return to river to spawn at 3-4 years. Spawns in waters ranging from large streams to small spring- fed tributaries; in shallow gravelly headwaters, rocky lake margins, or sometimes over sand or hard clay if no gravel available. Spawns in natal stream. Fry occupy quiet waters along shorelines or in shelter of objects that deflect flows (Sublette et al. 1990)."
Noturus gyrinus,"Most populations occur in clear, cool, well-oxygenated creeks, small to medium rivers, and lakes. Individuals may move from streams into lakes or the sea to avoid high temperatures in summer. Some populations migrate between freshwater and saltwater habitats. Other populations (known as ""coasters"") live in lakes and migrate to streams to spawn, or they remain in the lake to spawn. Preferred water temperature is around 14-16 C; brook trout do poorly where water temperature exceeds 20 C for extended periods (see Sublette et al. 1990). Spawning occurs in cool water (usually less than 15 C) usually over gravel beds in shallow headwaters but also may occur in gravelly shallows of lakes if spring (groundwater) upwelling and moderate current or nearby surficial inflow (Quinn 1995) are present. Eggs are buried in nests in gravel. In Ontario, eggs were buried at 7-20 cm in bottom substrate (Snucins et al. 1992)."
Noturus insignis,"Lakes; pools, backwaters, and runs of medium to large rivers; generally in moderately deep waters. Avoids bright light. Generally in quiet water when not spawning. Often in beds of aquatic vegetation, in holes among tree roots, or in or near similar cover by day. A pH of 8-9 is most suitable. Adults avoid temperatures above 24 C, if possible. Greatest population densities under moderately turbid conditions or in deep clear lakes with strong deepwater forage base (Sublette et al. 1990). See McMahon et al. (1984) for further details, including a habitat suitability index model. Spawns in turbulent rocky areas in rivers, boulder to coarse gravel shoals of lakes, along riprap on dam face of reservoirs, and flooded marshes (Becker 1983, Sublette et al. 1990). Eggs are broadcast and abandoned, adhesive but may drift great distances. Larvae initially are pelagic, soon become bottom dwellers. Adults tend to return to formerly used spawning (and feeding) areas."
Noturus leptacanthus,"Clear headwaters, creeks, and small rivers; prefers streams less than 12 m wide and with gravel-sand-silt substrate; occasionally in shallows of small clear lakes. Spawns in small gravelly streams in smooth water near a riffle, or over littoral areas of gravel in lakes. Eggs laid in pit made in bottom by male (or appropriated from stoneroller minnow); covers eggs with stones, forming a ridge (Scott and Crossman 1973, Johnston and Page 1992)."
Noturus munitus,"Small, clear headwater streams (Johnson and Ramsey 1990). Sand- and gravel-bottomed pools of creeks and small rivers (Page and Burr 1991). Males construct pit/ridge nests in gravel bottom. Eggs laid in nests (apparently of this species) on the bottom were in runs below pools with undercut banks (Johnson and Ramsey 1990)."
Oncorhynchus mykiss,"Coastal waters, bays, estuaries, and rivers; moves upstream in fresh water as far as Fall Line (Lee et al. 1980, Robins and Ray 1986). Spawns in fresh and brackish waters in shallows with submerged algal masses (Lee et al. 1980)."
Opsopoeodus emiliae,"Euryhaline. Common in bays, estuaries, and seagrass in shallow and deep flats in marine situations, and among submergent vegetation in adjacent fresh waters. Males incubate eggs in brood pouch."
Oreochromis aureus,"Coastal waters (to about 75 m), estuaries, and coastal rivers; may range hundreds of miles upstream (Robins and Ray 1986). Spawns in various salinities and temperatures, mostly in moderately saline (10-16 ppt) waters at about 25 C. Larvae move upstream into fresh water after hatching."
Oreochromis niloticus,"This troglodytic species is known only from cool (10-14 C), clear, waters of cave streams, underground lakes, wells, and outlets of springs, over mixed gravel, sand, and mud substrates (Burr and Warren 1986, Pflieger 1997, Boschung and Mayden 2004). Most occupied locations have a permanently effluent spring that discharges at the surface into a spring pool or that contributes to a cave stream or the filling of a sink hole (Noltie and Wicks 2001). Immersed substrates vary from exposed bedrock to clays; coarser substrates generally are found where the spring upwelling occurs, especially where the effluent flows are large and the spring throat expansive (Noltie and Wicks 2001). <br><br>However, the sites where southern cavefish are seen appear not to be representative of the deep, subterranean aquatic habitats (up to at least 240 meters below the land surface) in which most individuals occur. ""Instead, they represent atypical habitats into which fish have been flushed/washed/carried or transported"" (Noltie and Wicks 2001). Southern cavefish appear not to be long-term inhabitants of the spaces that are humanly accessible (Noltie and Wicks 2001)."
Paralichthys lethostigma,"Quiet, mud-bottomed, often heavily vegetated streams, sloughs, swamps, and ponds, particularly along margins, over sand, mud, and debris. Spawning sites probably are similar to those of <i>U. limi</i>."

Adults tend to move offshore for winter. Reported to occur in freshwater as far as 23 miles upstream from brackish water (Phillips et al. 1989). Most spawn offshore over outer continental shelf; some may spawn inshore; eggs and larvae are pelagic (Manooch 1984). In offshore waters of North Carolina, larvae are most dense in mid-water and at bottom during day, appear to migrate to surface at night; in nearshore waters, larval concentrations greatest on bottom both day and night (Phillips et al. 1989). Seagrass meadows and tidal creeks are important nursery habitats for postlarval individuals and juveniles (Phillips et al. 1989)."

Gobiesox strumosus,"This species is found in sandy mud below sand bars in sluggish water and eddies (Johnson, 1970). Clarke (1981) collected <i>Alasmidonta arcula</i> from the Ocmulgee River in mid-channel areas on sand bars in shallow water (< 1 meter). In 1996 it was found in the Altamaha River mainstem in silty sand and detritus in a backwater area (J. Brim Box, pers. obs.)."
Gobioides broussonnetii,"This species was known only from a single specimen collected from the Coosa River in St. Clair County, Alabama prior to its impoundment (Mirarchi, 2004; Athearn, 1964).  It was collected alive from shallow, swift water in sand and gravel substrate in an area thickly strewn with rock debris from Lock and Dam 2 (Athearn, 1964)."
Gobionellus oceanicus,"This species is found in big rivers (e.g. mainstem Apalachicola) in muddy sand with moderate current (Heard, 1979).  Historically, this species was found in larger creeks and river mainstems and seemed to prefer sandy mud, particularly in and around rock pools (Clench and Turner, 1956).  In Chattahoochee River tributaries, it was found in sand bars, but was absent near rocks or in muddy sediments.  Brim Box and Williams (2000) found two live specimens in a sand and silt substrate."
Gobiosoma bosc,"This species is found in coarse to fine gravel with sand and mud in smaller streams with slow current, as well as in lakes and ponds (Ortmann 1919; Clark 1981; Nedeau et al. 2000)."
Gymnura lessae,This species is found in creeks and rivers of varying sizes with moderate flow and stable substrates along intact riparian corridors (USFWS 2018).
Hippocampus erectus,This species is found in small to large streams and lakes with substrates ranging from silt and sand to cobble and in slow to fast currents (NCWRC 2024).
Hypleurochilus geminatus,"Almost nothing has been reported on the habitat of this species, although it appears to be confined to the main channel of large rivers. Hurd (1974) found one live <i>Amblema </i>and one shell in a reservoir, but did not consider this species characteristic of the reservoir fauna.  According to Williams et al. (2008), it occurs in large creeks to large rivers in slow to strong current in substrates of sand, gravel and cobble from depths of less than 1 m to more than 6 m."
Lagodon rhomboides,"Found in the main channels of small to large rivers in slow to moderate current, not their tributaries; does not tolerate impoundments. Substrate varies from gravel to cobble to a mixture of sand and sandy mud (Butler et al., 2003).  Heard (1979) notes its typical occurrence ""in muddy sand in moderate current"". Sizable population found in slow current over muddy sand with numerous cypress stumps at Chipola River below Dead Lake.  It usually favors the side of the river that is not eroding but rather is receiving deposition of sand and silt, but not in huge amounts as seen on major sandbars; such sites usually support young willows (Alderson, 2009)."
Leiostomus xanthurus,"This species inhabits ponds, canals, and slow-moving sections of rivers in a variety of substrates, including silt, sand, gravel, cobble, and occasionally clay; it is usually found in water bodies close but not necessarily connected to the ocean (Johnson 1970; Nedeau et al. 2000)."

In the mainstem of the Savannah River, this species was found only on sand bars (Britton and Fuller, 1979). Johnson (1970) reported it from the main channel of rivers and larger tributaries in swift current over sandy substrate, but did not specify from what drainages those observations were made. His observations may have been based on <i>Elliptio mcmichaeli</i>, a closely related species endemic to the Choctawhatchee River system that also is known to occur on sand bars in swift current."

Prionotus evolans,"Almost nothing is known about its habitat (Brim Box and Williams, 2000). Johnson (1968) noted that <i>Elliptio nigella </i>was found among rocks in muddy sand, although it is not clear whether this observation was based on <i>E. nigella</i>, <i>Elliptio purpurella</i>, or <i>Elliptio strigosus</i> [= <i>Elliptio arctata</i>]. This species was formerly known from Coolewahee Creek, a tributary of the Flint River, at a site that is spring-fed with a substrate consisting mainly of sand and limestone rock.  The rarity of Elliptio nigella in museum collections has long been recognized, and suggests that this species has narrow habitat requirements."

Tributary creeks and rivers occasionally provide significant habitat. Best populations occur where anadromous fish (probable primary fish hosts) have access to lotic habitats. Small or declining populations may be found above dams and their associated reservoirs which serve as barriers to anadromous fish. (It is assumed that less appropriate secondary fish hosts may occur in such areas.) Presently, this species is usually found in near-shore trough habitats in sand / gravel substrates. It may also be found in more coarse substrates.  In the Pee Dee River drainage in South Carolina, it was usually found in deep run habitats dominated by coarse sand/pea gravel, and fairly swift flow. It was most commonly associated with the Carolina lance and Carolina slabshell (Catena Group, 2006).<br>"
Scomberomorus maculatus,This species is generally found in fine gravel substrate and moderate current but can be found on a variety of substrates in small to large rivers.
Selene setapinnis,"The spines of the Altamaha spiny mussel presumably help anchor individuals in the shifting sand bottom which is its preferred habitat. Sickel (1980) found the species only in sandbars of coarse to fine sand in the main stem of the Altamaha. Keferl (1981) collected individuals in stable portions of sand banks in the Ohoopie.  USFWS (2005) includes the following habitat description: associated with stable, coarse to fine sandy sediments of sandbars, sloughs, and mid-channel islands and appears to be restricted to swiftly flowing water."

Gangloff, pers. comm., 2007)."
Urophycis floridana,"This is considered to be a species of relatively fast waters with high quality riverine/large creek habitat. It is typically found in headwaters or rural watersheds. The preferred habitat of the Atlantic pigtoe is coarse sand and gravel at the downstream edge of riffles. It is less common in sand, cobble and mixtures of sand, silt and detritus (Bogan and Alderman, 2004). The Atlantic pigtoe requires fast flowing, well oxygenated streams and is restricted to fairly pristine habitats.  Adams et al. (1990) state that <i>Fusconaia masoni</i> prefers yielding substrates of sands or gravel below riffles."

Lasmigona etowaensis,"The Savannah lilliput tends to inhabit shallow water, usually at the edges of streams (often very shallow), rivers and lakes; it may also be found in backwaters. This mussel is rarely found in deeper lake waters and it tends to be found in soft substrates like mud or silty sand. It will move up and down as the water levels fluctuate (Johnson 1970a; Bogan and Alderman 2004; Bogan 2002)."
Lasmigona holstonia,"This species is found in large rivers with gravel or rocky substrates.  Because of its apparent adaptability to a variety of habitat conditions, this species may be found living at river depths of one foot up to 20 feet and in a substrate composed of coarse gravel, sand, and/or mud (Parmalee and Bogan, 1998)."

Obovaria subrotunda,"This species may be tolerant of a wide range of habitats, as Clench and Turner (1956) found <i>Villosa villosa </i> in spring-fed streams and clear rivers, and Johnson (1970) reported it from the tannic-stained and muddy waters of the St. Marys River. In Florida, <i>V. villosa</i> was found in mud and muddy sand of reservoirs, and in muddy sand in moderate current (Heard, 1979). Butler (1989) noted this species could be abundant in habitats with slack current, murky water and muddy substrates, and that in these habitats individuals were larger than in more lotic environments. Information included in historical collections indicate this species occurred in substrates that consisted of mud, sand, vegetation or silt. All of the <i>V. villosa</i> found in a recent survey of the ACF Basin occurred at sites that contained primarily sandy substrates (Brim Box and Williams, 2000)."

Haldeman (in Tryon, 1873) stated that this species lived in quiet waters along the river's edge, but Tryon (1873) doubted that this was its typical habitat. If it did prefer such a habitat as Haldeman conveyed, it probably would not have been so impacted by the impounding of most of its range. Probably occurs on coarse particle substrates in vicinity of riffles."

Ventridens arcellus,"It lives in streams under rocks (Schuster and Taylor, 2004). It has a broader ecology than either of its close relatives C. longulus and C. chasmodactylus and is by far the least ecologically restricted of the three (James 1966). It inhabits large and small freshwater permenant streams, usually found in the riffle areas (James 1966)."
Ventridens cerinoideus,"Cambarus manningi is found under rocks in riffle areas of clear, moderate to swift flowing streams (Hobbs 1981)."
Ventridens collisella,"Cambarus nodosus is a primary burrowing crayfish which is found in pools, seepage areas and occasionally in the riffle areas of streams. This species can also be found in sphagnum bogs. The substrate of the river is sand and mica with stretches of bed rock and scattered small to large rocks (Bouchard and Hobbs 1976). This species is probably a generalist as females with eggs and young has been found in ditches next to roads in more than one locality (Bouchard and Hobbs 1976)."
Ventridens decussatus,"Very swift, clear water flowing over a bed of sand and rocks. Although <i>C. hiwasseensis</i> and <i>C. parrishi</i> are both endemic to the Hiwassee River, <i>C. hiwasseensis</i> appears to be replaced by <i>C. parrishi</i> in smaller headwater tributaries; as the two species have never been found together at any locality (McGrath, 1998)."
Ventridens demissus,Cambarus parvoculus is found in rocky streams (Fetzner 2008). C. parvoculus is quite a specialist as its arbitary tolerance values of water quality were 2.5-3.5 with other more gneralist species have values of 2.2-6.8. These values also show that C. parvoculus requires more pristine water than other more tollerant species (Peake et al. 2004).
Ventridens gularis,Cambarus reflexus is a primary burrower found in seepage areas. Burrows are often in root mats and have two openings (Hobbs 1981).
Ventridens intertextus,"Is most abundant in areas with swift water and rocks (Hobbs, 1981)."
Ventridens lawae,This species is found in clear to slightly cloudy pools and stream margins with sand and rocky substrates (Schuster 2001).
Ventridens pilsbryi,"A species of burrowing crayfish, preferential to clay soils (Glon, 2021), where freshwater is major habitat (WoRMS, 2023)."
Ventridens theloides,"It lives in streams under rocks, but can also be a primary or secondary burrower (Schuster and Taylor, 2004). Heath et al. (2010) found a single specimen burrowed in hard soil densely meshed with roots in Alabama (Choctawhatchee basiin)."
Vertigo alabamensis,"This species forms elaborate burrows in sandy clay substrates, in densely matted with roots, and in high organic matter soils. Adult <i>Cambarus strigosus</i> crayfish are found in complex burrows in sandy-clay soils near streams or in areas with a high water table (a water level near the surface). The burrows of this species are built in soil that is rich in organic matter. The constructed burrows often have multiple branches and at least one chamber that extends below the water table. The openings of the burrow are usually marked with chimneys (mounds of sand or mud placed around openings above ground). Occasionally it leaves the general safety of its burrow to search for food or a mate at night (Hobbs, 1981)."
Vertigo malleata,Complex burrows; roadside ditches; sandy clay or clay substrate (Skelton 2010). This species is a primary burrowing species found in complex burrows in sandy clay soil (Hobbs 1981). Complex burrows adjacent to streams or in low areas where the water table is near the surface of the ground. Burrowing crayfishes inhabit a system of tunnels that may be very complex with several openings to the surface.
Vertigo milium,"It lives in streams under rocks (Schuster and Taylor, 2004). It is found in permanent rocky streams (Hobbs and Hall 1969). In Georgia, this species is found in medium sized mountain streams from beneath rocks in moderate to swift current (GA DNR, pers. comm., 2009)."
Vertigo oralis,"A species of burrowing crayfish (Guiasu, 2021), where freshwater is major habitat (WoRMS, 2023)."
Vertigo oscariana,Burrows in floodplain in sandy clay soil.
Vertigo ovata,"It occurs in slow streams, marshes, swamps and ditches; and can be a tertiary burrower (Schuster and Taylor, 2004).  In Missouri, it occurs in small intermittent creeks and the shallows of seasonally flooded sloughs and swamps; but for much of the year it is sequestered in burrows (Pflieger, 1996).  In wet seasons they emerge from chimneyless burrows of 0.7 to 1.2 feet deep to live in shallow sloughs, swamps, ditches and overflow pools (Johnson and Johnson, 2008)."
Vertigo teskeyae,"Generally found in small gravel streams. According to Bouchard and Bouchard (1995) it has been found in a variety of habitats including riffle areas (under rocks), pools, along the shore, as well as in the leaf litter and root masses of riparian trees. <span><span><span>Freshwater is major habitat (WoRMS, 2023).</span></span></span>"
Vitrinizonites latissimus,"This species can be found in streams under rocks (Schuster and Taylor, 2004)."
Xolotrema caroliniense,"This species can be found in streams under rocks (Schuster and Taylor, 2004)."
Xolotrema fosteri,"It inhabits streams and creeks with gravel, cobble and mud substrates (Taylor 2000)."
Zonitoides arboreus,"Preferred habitat is permanently running streams with clay banks and sand and coarse gravel substrate (Hogger, 1988).  Pflieger (1996) claims it is strictely confined to flowing waters in ditches and streams, not swamps sloughs and natural lakes.  In Texas, holes in steep banks and root masses are the favored cover during daytime in more permanent streams and Red River tributaries are usually shallow except during rainy periods when submerged rocks and logs become favored sites in shallow stream beds (Johnson and Johnson, 2008)."
Zonitoides elliotti,"This species is found in streams under rocks (Schuster and Taylor, 2004)."
Zonitoides patuloides,"This species has been collected from streams and rivers (Mirarchi et al., 2004; Schuster and Taylor, 2004; Schuster et al., 2008). This species is a primary burrower in wetlands and can be found in many places where the water table is near the surface. Furthermore, LeGrand et al. (2006) has found this species in small creeks and pools while Simmons and Fraley (2010) found it in shallow streamside burrows at 2 sites in the Hiwassee River floodplain along small streams impounded by the Hiwassee Reservoir at full pool with a third site along a private reservoir dug from burrows in a wet area of a mowed lawn (burrows in clay soil up to 5 m from the water edge)."
Corbicula fluminea,"This species usually burrows in alluvial soils of stream floodplains, and in anthropogenically altered habitats like roadside ditches, the banks of ponds, and urban lawns (Glon et al., 2019)."
Crassostrea virginica,"Can be excavated almost anywhere where water table is near surface; lives as primary burrower in burrows constructed in timbered and formerly timbered areas along streams and ditches (Pflieger, 1996).  In Texas, it burrows near permanent streams and is in surface waters during sprign and after rains but usually remains within the immediate vicinity of its burrow."
Pisidium dubium,"This species is found in slow streams, pools and roadside ditches (Schuster and Taylor, 2004)."
Spurwinkia salsa,"Widely tolerant, in most lentic situations in range and in sluggish streams.  In Missouri, it is most often found in sloughs, marshes and natural lakes along the flood plains of streams (70% from standing water, 19% from ditches, 11% from small to medium sized streams, 0% from open channels of rivers) (Pflieger, 1996).  In West Virginia, it was often found in ephemeral wetland habitats in cotrast to observations in Illinois, where it was collected primarily from sluggist streams (Loughman, 2007)."
Crangonyx antennatus,"It is a primary burrowing species, spending the major part of its life in complex burrows. Most of the tunnel systems have at least three potential surface exists marked by low, carelessly constructed chimneys, one or more may be plugged. In as much as the tunnels are largely confined to flatwoods or boggy areas where the water table is near the surface, few of the deep passages extend downward for more than 1.5 m (Hobbs, 1981)."
Crangonyx floridanus,"In pure water channels that run between the hills of the sandhills (""in aquae purae rivulos qui inter colliculos arenosos currunt"")."
Crangonyx richmondensis,It is a secondary burrower which can be found in lentic situations.
Crangonyx serratus,Procambarus caritus is a primary burrowing species found in streams in rolling pine woods and pine flatwoods (Hobbs 1981).
Stygobromus ackerlyi,"In Missouri, it occurs more often in flowing water habitats than the white river crayfish (61% lowland streams and ditches, 79% of these with noticeable current or flow), but also in swamps, sloughs and roadside pools; bottom usually mud or sand, often where there were considerable quantities of organic debris such as logs, sticks or water-soaked tree leaves (Pflieger, 1996).  It is very tolerant of low oxygen and high temperature; is a secondary burrower; and is found in almost every type habitat in sluggish streams and lentic situations. It is one of few North American crayfishes with salinity tolerance."
Stygobromus dicksoni,"Procambarus enoplosternum inhabits small, moderately flowing, clear stream tributaries with a sand substrate (Hobbs 1946; Hobbs 1958). ."
Stygobromus grandis,<i>Procambarus epicyrtus</i> inhabits streams of varying sizes with sand and clay substrates. It is unknown whether this is a burrowing species (Hobbs 1981).
Stygobromus minutus," It is a very variable species in its habitat and is considered to be a habitat generalist, inhabiting both lentic and lotic situations It is found in lentic such as ditches, and lotic situations and burrows (Hobbs 1942). Hobbs (1942) indicates that this species has a very variable habitat range, and will occur in any freshwater habitat providing there is sufficient vegetation to provide protection from predators."
Cambarus asperimanus,"According to Hobbs (1981) it is restricted to lotic waters, of all sizes and does not shun swift water and may even be found in riffle areas. GA DNR (pers. comm., 2009) reports it from sand bottomed streams with macrophytes in clear, free flowing water; often in riffle habitat."
Cambarus bartonii,"It lives in slow streams and lentic environments (Schuster and Taylor, 2004). In ponds, adults used deeper water by day moving into shallow waters or even terrestrial habitats by night (Payne, 1972). This species is also a secondary burrower (Payne, 1972)."
Cambarus conasaugaensis,It is a tertiary burrowing species. This species is found in a wide range of habitat types but is most commonly found in submerged dense vegetations in slow to moderately fast flowing streams (Hobbs 1981).
Cambarus coosae,"This species occurs in streams in swampy areas with sand substrate (Hobbs, Jr, 1946). Freshwater is major habitat (WoRMS, 2023)."
Cambarus coosawattae,"It occurs in lentic and lotic environments; and is a tertiary burrower (Schuster and Taylor, 2004)."
Cambarus cryptodytes,"It inhabits ponds, lakes, swamps and roadside ditches. This species is a secondary or tertiary burrower (Hobbs, 1981)."
Cambarus cymatilis,"It occurs in lentic and lotic environments, and rarely in caves; tertiary burrower (Hobbs, 1989)."
Cambarus distans,"Karst cave systems with fresh water; only weakly attracted to sinks and other energy input areas. Reportedly associated with caves that have high flow in newly emerging karst areas. May venture out into the lighted portions of some ""blue hole"" sinks (Deyrup and Franz 1994)."
Cambarus doughertyensis,"It occurs in lotic systems of various sizes (Hobbs, 1981)."
Cambarus englishi,"It is a tertiary burrower which inhabits streams (Brown, 1981; Hobbs, 1989)"
Cambarus extraneus,Both <i>Procambarus pubischelae pubischelae </i>and  <i>Procambarus pubischelae deficiens </i>are found in lentic and sluggish lotic situations and are secondary burrowers (Hobbs 1942).
Cambarus fasciatus,"It is found in both permanent lentic and lotic situations amongst vegetation, and is a secondary burrower (Hobbs, 1942)."
Cambarus georgiae,All of the specimens collected for this species have been from permanent streams.
Cambarus girardianus,"It is found in clear, swift streams, stagnant pools, roadside ditches, flatwood ponds and is a secondary burrower (Hobbs, 1942). This species is a habitat generalist."
Cambarus halli,"This is a generalist stream species (Schuster and Taylor, 2004). This species prefers deep water sites but adults can be found in shallow sandy bottomed streams. It is not tolerant of temperature changes and is susceptible to dessication during droughts (Caine, 1978). This species is sympatric with many different crayfish species including, <i>P. versatus</i>, <i>Cambarus latimanus</i> and <i>C. englishi</i>, although it may be outcompeted by larger crayfish (Ratcliff and DeVries, 2004)."
Cambarus harti,"it is a primary burrower (Hobbs, 1981)."
Cambarus hiwasseensis,it is a tertiary burrower which inhabits lentic and lotic environments.
Cambarus howardi,"It is found in seepage areas in colonies where each member digs its own complex burrow (Hobbs 1954, 1981)."
Cambarus latimanus,"This is a stream species (Schuster and Taylor, 2004). It is present in permanent, slow flowing streams with sandy substrates (Hobbs, 1952). It is also found in backwaters and woodland seeps (Stanton, 2003)."
Cambarus longirostris,"This is a stream species (Schuster and Taylor, 2004). Although it occurred most often in woody debris on sandy substrates in stream runs in southeastern Alabama, this is likely due to lack of availability of other substrate choices such as gravel or pebbles rather than habitat preference (Stewart et al., 2010)."
Cambarus manningi,Rock out crop temporary pools.
Cambarus nodosus,"Typically found in clear cool to cold water with neutral to low pH, in well vegeatated ephemeral pools"
Cambarus parrishi,"Typically found in clear cool water with neutral to low pH, in well vegetated ephemeral pools"
Cambarus parvoculus,"In Georgia, this species is known from shallow, flat bottomed depressional wetlands (pools) characterized by a variable, ephemeral hydroperiod subject to seasonal precipitation patterns, usually becoming inundated in late autumn and completely drying by late spring or early summer (Rogers et al. 2004). The site in Florida is characterized as a hydric hammock, which is an evergreen hardwood and/or palm forest with a variable understory typically dominated by palms and ferns occurring on moist soils, often with limestone very near the surface (FNAI 2010)."

Faxonius palmeri creolanus,"Ohio shrimp apparently prefer low velocity water (Conaway and Hrabik, 1997); however, open side channels, a preferred habitat of Ohio shrimp, have flow during normal river elevations (Barko and Herzog, 2003). Ohio shrimp prefer borders of the main channel, especially when the borders are flooded and plant and animal material are available for foraging (Truesdale and Mermilliod, 1979). Ohio Shrimp have been reported to have greater abundance in areas with suspended particulate matter, which may be a predator avoidance response. Ohio shrimp occupy low visibility physical habitats that are also occupied by predatory fishes, such as flathead catfish, a species that is not native to South Carolina (Barko and Herzog, 2003). "
